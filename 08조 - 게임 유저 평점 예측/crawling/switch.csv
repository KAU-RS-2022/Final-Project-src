The game is incredibly boring, often offers nothing to do but grinding for resources or struggling to kill but the simplest of enemies. The progression system in the game feels all out of whack, making the player feel no matter how far they progress their obstacles will always be large, and the world, generally empty, for such a large open world they didn't put too much into it. They should have put more time into the game, if they did, this could have been a really decent game.

The load times are generally very good with the longest time being around 30 seconds when starting up the game. The controls will feel wired, clunky, and awkward when you start playing but will improve through muscle memory. For best experience however, I recommend docked for the larger screen, although it’s decent on the go, but expect around 2 Hours of playtime. My only nitpick with this port is it’s block cap being 25,000. This makes the game feel more like a demo at times and limits your ability to be imaginative.

They have averaged around 8.5 for this entry and generally seem more interested in setting up the custom controls properly than the average publication... I think that KT has done a terrific job with this port given the limitations of the hardware, just like they did with WRC8. The sense of speed is beyond anything else on the Switch including FastRMX. Yes, it is punishing and difficult to avoid finishing in last place all the time when you start out, but for those who have been dealing with MotoGP since much earlier handhelds this is heartfelt blessing of a game. If you play on the bigscreen, yeah get it on a more powerful console... They opted for performance over graphics with this, and that was the right way to go. The only time it becomes a problem is when the tracks are still new and looking ahead for the next turn is a bit muddy. The workaround is to keep checking the side map until you have memorized the track, which is part of the sport tbh. Yes the penalties for restarting are tough to chew but there is a terrific open world mode free ride mode to get good. Use the analog stick for gas, it will be worth it in time."

Sports|Individual|Other|Biking|,"Apr  5, 2018",E,Tate Multimedia,67,Teyon,Urban Trial Playground,6.4,I was a fan of the 3DS Urban Trial games and didn't know until later they had even better versions on PS4/XB1/PC/etc. I fell in love with the simplicity of the concept. Its easy to learn but has quite a bit of nuance to master. For anyone who is new to the series its like an on rails physics puzzler with dirt bikes and stunts. Almost gives me a bit of a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater feeling. I love the laid back music and theme of the game. The locations are beautiful and look great on the Switch screen and on the big screen. Playground for Switch is a great pick up and play game at a fair price. Perfect when you only have 1-15 minutes to spare or if you want to spend hours trying to unlock everything. It really fits right at home on the Switch. My main gripe about the game is that I wish I could restart a level without having to wait for load again. When respawning after a crash the game is very fast but if you want to restart even before you've hit the first checkpoint you have to wait a bit. The loads are fast so its a very small gripe. I also wish there were more unlockables but maybe there will be more after I beat it.  If you are considering buying the game I would just go for it or wait for a sale. It's already really cheap on the eshop and I think almost any gamer could enjoy it. I hope they bring more to the Switch with even more levels and customization. With so many digital games coming to the Switch in it's first year it would be a shame to see this gem get lost amidst all the releases. I gave this a 10 because it's exactly what I wanted. Try the demo and see how you feel about it.

The way this made you think and made it a little challenging occasionally made it great fun. It has killed a couple of evenings and probably going to get a 3rd evening from it and was less than £2.  £2 of wine, or beer wouldn't even last me 30 minutes.  Ok, so it looks nice and combines puzzles and hidden objects and some inbetween puzzles to enable you to access some hidden objects. Looks nice, sounds nice, fun to play. This isn't a 10/10 game but within its genre I think it did a superb job. I am rating it in its field and price range, not comparing to £50 games. It's a steal at that price."

Action|Platformer|2D|,"Jun 22, 2021",E,Team17,73,Astral Pixel,Super Magbot,tbd,"This game is immediately fun and definitely unique among other precision platformers. It clearly draws a lot of inspiration from super meat boy as far as level design goes and the very precise nature of the platforming, much like other games in that genre that SMB spawned. However it comes with a completely unique set of gameplay mechanics and an amazing art style. It is more mature than super meat boy and at the same time more kid friendly. I was skeptical when I downloaded the demo, thinking it would be a fairly bland dime a dozen platformer. However I was very quickly intrigued by the unique controls and mechanic and I bought it right away. Then very quickly I was charmed by the art style and the characters. Yes it is a platformer and there isn’t depth to the story or character back story. But there is charm in droves. It’s very lighthearted and warm. And once you understand the mechanic you pretty naturally pick it up and learn on pace with the level design. It is not overly difficult as far as these style of games go.

Don’t expect a fair challenge since this 80s arcade game was designed to drain your wallet. Luckily there are save states but these don’t save you from carpal tunnel at the harder bosses. In fact the repetition of a boss, because you can save state, ensures you just get it much quicker. And this is on normal mode. There is even a hard mode and other challenges. If you love getting punished over and over this is certainly the game for you. That being said it isn’t a bad game. The visuals and soundtrack sure make you feel nostalgic. It is very charming in presentation. But as with many 80s arcade games there are mechanics in place to ensure you die quick and often and keep you spending those tokens.

Strategy|Turn-Based|General|,"Jan 10, 2019",E,Wonderland Kazakiri inc.,76,Wonderland Kazakiri inc.,BQM - BlockQuest Maker-,7.6,"BQM fills a niche which so far seems to be ignored on the Switch of a user generated level builder.  In a few more months there will be a juggernaut filling this hole with Super Mario Maker 2, but I feel that BQM will still be a worthy complement to SMM2 since it is more related to Zelda-like dungeon crawlers than side scroll SMB based levels.  Due to a lack of user reviews I held off on purchasing this title until it recently went on sale.  I am happy to report that BQM has turned out to be mostly what I hoped it would be.  There are a reasonable number of themed building blocks, monster types and traps that users can unlock for content creation.  A game like this requires a solid base of creators and I feel that the current community involvement is sufficient for the cost of the title.  My largest complaint about the game is that the game is basically crippled when not connected to the internet.  It would be nice to be able to queue up some levels to play on the go.  Also it would be nice to have a few more conditional switch options for level creation.  Ideally there would be at least one item which the user can define on a per instance basis to be ""AND"", ""NOT"", or ""OR"".  Aside from these complains I feel that BQM is a must for anybody who enjoys user generated content and/or mini dungeon crawlers.  Even at full price there is a lot of bang for your buck here.  Note to developer: If any of the developers are reading this review, I would suggest making a free demo for this game to improve the visibility.  Since this game is highly dependent on a large and active community of users it may also be helpful if you allow demo users to generate one or two free small levels that they can share to get a feel for the editor and increase the amount of content for everybody."

It's a fast paced beat-em-up type game with minor RPG elements which has you constantly running through wave after wave of enemies, either slashing them with your swords or throwing your ninja stars at them. The visuals are bright and cheerful, and the cast of characters are just as enjoyable. There is a HUGE variety in equipment, the selection of different weapons and passive abilities to use and experiment with is huge, and it will all genuinely affect how you play and require some strategy in how you plan your character. The different enemies are all so creative and require varying strategies from one another to defeat. Different combinations of enemies prove to consistently be challenging and interesting to fight throughout the entire game as well. The game paces its difficulty extremely well and the later stages are genuinely really difficult even in co-op. The co-op itself is integrated into the game so well, both online and local co-op is quick and easy to use - and playing in co-op doesn't make the game that much easier surprisingly - it is very well balanced. The game would be a blast with or without a buddy to play with, I think it might work best with two players however. The game has a really nice and crisp pixel art style with some retro-inspired music to accompany it which is just so great to listen to while playing. It's a really neat, simple little game which tries to be nothing except fun, and it is, it is really fun.

Adventure|Visual Novel|,"Dec 10, 2019",M,Spike Chunsoft,79,Hobibox,Steins;Gate 0,8.2,"I'm coming into this game after playing Steins;Gate Elite, which was one of my all-time favorite games. It very well may be the best visual novel I've ever played, in my opinion. I just wanted to make clear before I give my review that I have never played the original 2009 Steins;Gate game. Steins;Gate 0 came out about 6 years after that game. While I'm almost one hundred percent sure that, other than localization, the concept writing is obviously what takes up most of the development time for the Chiyomaru games, I will go ahead & criticize the art for this game. I know there are many hardcore S;G fans who religiously appreciate the designs from Huke, even to the point that some fans denounce the considerably well done anime & upgraded version of the first game I already mentioned, Steins;Gate Elite, done by White Fox. Unfortunately for S;G0, there were several times where there wasn't a sprite made at all for scenes, I even got tired of the character backdrops that got used instead of new sprites. While I enjoy the art Huke has done, I think it's horribly inexcusable that SO many sprites were reused from the original game. I'm not necessarily blaming Huke, here. However, it was clear despite never having played the original that many sprites got used from the 6-years-older original, which is incredibly sloppy to me. Normally this wouldn't really bother me... but the sprites that are updated with winter outfits look very different than the original sprites, so the reused ones look extremely bizarre to be included. This is even more apparent with how different the styles are when the setting is in summer again & you're seeing new characters next to the reused summer sprites. There were also many, many lines with the ""lip sync"" turned on that the mouth did not animate at all while characters were speaking. I'm unsure about if the time allotted for development was the issue, if it was money, or what, but I hate seeing such a high quality written visual novel look so clearly cheaply made. Which brings me to the positive notes I had: this was still a very good story with characters I love. The voice acting is excellent & the sound design, as expected, is incredible. The music is very well composed & makes for a great tone setting. I was surprised about the Switch port not having any changes made to the several mistakes in the script, but for how many lines there are, there really aren't that many discrepancies (other than with the RINE text messages, sometimes those didn't make sense at all). Also the auto scroll feature is in dire need of adjustment, even at max speed the non-voiced sections move about four times slower than the voiced dialogue. I don't know how the original S;G handled its multiple endings, but I do wish the flags for the choices diverging was much more clear, but it's very easy to just look up how to achieve all the endings without getting spoiled. I know it sounds like I was very down on this game, but I did enjoy my time with it. Hopefully the upcoming Steins;Gate 0 Elite will be on par with Steins;Gate Elite and remedy my issues with the art in particular."

I would highly recommend this game for people that enjoy Binding of Isaac or enter the gungeon but in this game you are not encouraged to kill every Zombie.  You are reminded to avoid and run to conserve bullets when you can.  I paid 8.99 and i bought it twice (ps4,Switch) I have no regrets.  It's a fun addicting game.  the greatest thing about this game is the custom characters,  you can add everyone you know and they join the adventure.  The only things I would change is the over all look is done in that 8 bit style which i am sick of.  it would look better in 16 bit.  8 bit sucks... but maybe it's because I am older and remember playing 8 bit when it was all that I had.  I also think there should be more weapons,  more of everything.  If you're gonna do random, make a ton of weapons and items.  But anyways, what do i know.  Looking forward to a sequel!"

This game's puzzles are simple yet challenging and fun, perfect bite sized brain - teasers for the switch. Every single world introduces a new mechanic, and that mechanic is used a fair amount, not enough to feel tired, but more than just scratching the surface. The story is minimalist, yet the cutscenes are still charming and engaging. If you have an extra $10 don't go the wrong way."

What's more, there seems to be an eerie presence that's watching all of this from the shadows. After groping around for clues, MO gradually becomes aware that it is responsible for a mission of immense importance. Under the guidance of the mysterious mutterings in its ear, MO is able to overcome one obstacle after another."
