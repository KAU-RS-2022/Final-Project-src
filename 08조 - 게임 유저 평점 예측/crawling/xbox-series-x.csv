Action|Strategy|Turn-Based|Shooter|First-Person|Tactics|Arcade|,"Jun  1, 2021",M,Focus Home Interactive,56,Focus Home Interactive,Necromunda: Hired Gun,5.3,"First a tip for players, set aiming assist to 50% and controller deadzone to 10% this cleans up aiming issues a lot. A disappointing FPS hampered by bugs. I really had high hopes for this game. Necromunda: HR is a fast paced frantic FPS in the style of Doom and that's what hooked me. A Doom style game set in 40K? Yes yes yes.There is wall running, double jumping, and even a grappling hook. The set pieces are intricately designed with the lore in mind and there is so much to look at the game nails almost all of it. The narrative is hardly original, you are a bounty hunter betrayed on the first mission and looking for revenge. But hardly anyone plays shooters for the story. When it comes to gameplay the game throws endless waves of enemies at you as you progress through levels. Levels can range from small sewer's to huge open spaces. There are tons of nooks and crannies to explore and the devs have hidden loot chests and pick ups all over the maps. Problem is, sometimes the HUD does not give good indication of where you need to go. There are four catagories of guns (pistol, special, heavy, and basic) all of which can be customized and two catagories of special trait items that effect stats. And that is where we come to some of the games glaring issues. For a supposed ""looter"" the loot menu and loadout screen is horrendously bad. There is little in the way of information on how special items work and most seem inconsequential. It feels like the loot system was thrown in with little planning or thought because it feels so shallow. There are some bugs as of right now (camera movement, clipping through walls during takedowns, the gun not shooting). Wall running is different in HR than in Titanfall. Instead of just automatically happening like in Titanfall you have to hold down A (which is also the jump button). You can see the issue when pressing A twice does a double jump. It makes wall running frustrating and honestly I use it very little unless forced to. I am sure they will be patched soon and when they do I will come back and update my review.  At this point I cannot recommend this game on XBSX until it is patched. Once it has been there is great potential for it to be a fun mindless shooter."

Sports|Individual|Tennis|,"Mar 30, 2021",None,Maximum Games,55,Big Ant Studios,Tennis World Tour 2,5.8,"Tennis World Tour 2 is a tennis video game developed by Breakpoint Studio and published by Maximum Games. Tennis World Tour 2 is now the best tennis game of the next generation; a large improvement over the embarrassment of its original Xbox One predecessor that still had many issues after its launch patch. The best tennis video games offer addictive gameplay, and solid control and brilliant graphics. At the genre’s best, there’s something about executing the shots that excites you and encourages you to play this time around. Tennis World Tour 2 doesn’t quite have that quality, but it’s not the worst gameplay experience your encounter either. I have many fond memories of my time with my arcade version of Sega's Virtua Tennis 2 so I am a bit of a tough critic on Tennis titles as a fan of the game and genre. The good section is a bit sparse, but there are some aspects of the game that pop because of good lighting. These bright spots are more prevalent for night matches. Those who have played AO Tennis 2 will find this system familiar. For the most part it is, although there is one crucial difference and it’s a change that almost ruins the experience for rookie players. This time around, there is no indicator to tell the player when to release the button and little consistency in regards to hitting a perfect shot. At the end of the day, I could go through all of the modes and talk about some of the other areas the game struggles but the core gameplay of Tennis World Tour 2 is just up to par with where it needs to be to be a solid Tennis title for your Xbox Series X. The mechanics and the animation feel a bit dated and somewhat bland but if your a seasoned player of the genre there is something here for you. If you aren't a traditional player of Tennis titles you may want to approach with a bit of caution from the changes made to the new version while improvements are apparent it can be a bit cumbersome for newer players in the end. As a fan I recommend it for your Xbox One library if you are a fan of the genre."

Racing|Arcade|Automobile|,"Mar 11, 2021",None,Koch Media,61,Milestone S.r.l,Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 4,5.5,"Monster Energy Supercross The Official VideoGame 4 as expected from the franchise, shines in its career mode as always. While Career Mode isn’t technically the first thing that you need to do in this game, it’s most likely where you’ll be spending the most of your time earning your grips on the newest installment. Like with any racing game’s Career Mode, the objective is to motor out on the track in hopes of winning fame and of course rewards. Career Mode itself is divided into three different categories (Futures, Rookie, and Pro) with each sporting tougher competition; more races; the possibility for better rewards. While it’s nice that the basics are there, what really impressed me was that the devs really seemed to go out of the way to put in as many extras as possible. Rather than just throwing the player into multiple races back-to-back, you’re brought to a hub menu in between races. It’s here that you’re not only able to do the basics like look at player stats and perform maintenance on your motor bike a number of different mini-games await. While difficult, performing well in these mini-games nets you points that you can use on what this game has literally dubbed as a skill tree. Additionally, should you manage to impress the crowd during a race then you’ll occasionally be invited to special events where you’re challenged with performing various objectives on the track in order to win larger rewards. When it comes to actual racing Monster Energy Supercross 4 seems to be very particular about how its players handles the game. The drifting techniques that you picked up in many a range series come in handy here, but that’s just the beginning of things. In order to come out on top or for my sake, to just not come in last place then you’ve got to know supercross basics well. This, of course, means things like weight distribution, bike setup, acceleration technique, the proper way to jump, and so on. When it comes to the bare-bones basics of supercross, Monster Energy Supercross 4 doesn’t really tell you anything but I’m sure you’re likely no stranger to the series if you’re reading this. You’re expected to know it already, or go in and learn it. However, once you’re comfortable, this game is actually quite accommodating. There’s a myriad of options available to help players tweak the game settings to their liking. From the ability to have your character auto-adjust to the “Dynamic Flow” option which literally has giant blue arrows telling you how to optimally make your jumps and this game in the series may not be all that friendly in terms of welcoming you into the fold, but as in previous games in the series, once you’re in. The game is plenty accommodating. Things are, admittedly, a little less exciting when examining the courses themselves. This isn’t really anything to be upset about, though. Because M emulates a more realistic style of racing and the courses are also created in a realistic way to learn the ropes. If you’re into supercross, or genuinely appreciate realism, this shouldn’t be an issue at all. However, if you like your racing courses a little more crazy then this may not be your cup of tea as realism is on par for today’s courses. You’ve got usuals, of course, with things like Time Attack and Championship modes, but, once again (because I totally did this in the preview, too), I’d like to focus on a few of my favorites, the first being the Trac Editor and  while I can’t play all racing games out there, track editors really aren’t something that I see too often. And, while I personally can’t claim that I’m all too great at creating courses, it was fun being able to mess around on courses that other people made and play with fresh ideas abound. My favorite mode is the Compound which is a wide-open space featuring various mini-games and even a smattering of hidden collectibles, the Compound was probably one of my favorite things to play in the game this season since it gives you plenty of time to practice. Monster Energy Supercross 4 wants you to figure out its finer points, the Compound is a great place to freely practice. On a less important note, it also provides a nice change of pace from the arenas that you’re constantly biking around in. When it comes down to it,Monster Energy Supercross The Official VideoGame 4 is absolutely a game for previous fans of the franchise. So long as you already know about the sport, you probably won’t have too much of an issue jumping right into things, and I’m sure that you’ll enjoy all that the game has to offer. Those who may not know anything about supercross might want to watch out. While things are nice and friendly once you understand the basics, you’re in for a pretty rough start if you’re coming in completely new. If you are indeed a fan of the franchise then head on over to the Xbox digital games store and download the newest the franchise has on offer for you."

The trees and foliage are more green and lush. The trees also look better in shape. What does look better in WRC 9 is the evenings with that orange glow of the sun trough the trees. In WRC 10 it's white. The cars handle a lot better especially on tarmac in WRC 10. It's also a lot easier than WRC 9 to keep your car under control. The new Estonia stages are incredible!
