The missions had a great balance of fun and difficulty to them after the first few. The customization of mixing and matching different costumes was great and fun to play around with. Vex was a great villain but the story left a lot to be desired for me. I haven't played any of the LBP games and that may be why i don't understand the story and why vex is doing what he is doing and why he even showed up.

This game not only looks better, but plays better than last generation version, by leaps and miles. The graphics are absolutely stunning, gameplay feels as authentic as you can get to the real life thing, and some new additions have been made to MyCareer. MyCareer has extra options in the story mode of the game including going to the G-League rather than College, but the big addition is ""The City"". The City is an updated version of The Park. The City offers a large area where there is a ton of different options to explore, it's still a work in progress from a navigation stand point, but the ambition is going in the right direction. Only real constructive things I can mention that I would like improved is some more upgrades to MyLeague which is a great mode, but would benefit from extra addition such as the ability to play G-League games. I really like this game and do strongly recommend any fans of the NBA to check it out.","Nov 12, 2020"
