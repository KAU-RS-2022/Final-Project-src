Each of the groups has special abilities, e.g. cyborgs are good in combat, mutants are healing experts, nomads are masters of camouflage.

Leading this army is The Apocalypse Dragon, a seemingly unstoppable five headed juggernaut of destruction that has been reborn and set loose on an unprepared populace.  Taking the role of one of 5 characters, the player must band together with other legendary heroes to face this Dragon and defeat the forces of Chaos in the ""Mage Knight"" universe. Team dynamics are vital in Mage Knight Apocalypse, and players need to select their party carefully, combining melee, ranged and magical strikes in conjunction with overwhelming group combo attacks to triumph in battle. Players can quest alone or with friends in five-player cooperative and competitive play modes, working together or going head-to-head in the ultimate clash for battlefield supremacy.  Players can choose from five distinct character classes and customize them with hundreds of weapons, armor and items, equipping the right gear for each intense encounter.  Unlike other action RPGs, in Mage Knight Apocalypse, players have no need to worry about ability points or discreet levels to gain.  Instead, character development depends on what type of playing style the player enjoys.  Swinging a heavy sword makes you stronger, casting spells makes your magic more powerful, and shooting bows improve dexterity.

But you want to know about this game, and I shall oblige. First, let me say that I played Master of Magic back in the days of Microprose, and this game is not Master of Magic. There are hints of Age of Wonders, smatterings of Civilization 4, a bit of Galactic Civilizations, among others. The list of things that this game does right is too long, so let me just say this: this game is fun, if you are into the genre. I played a bit of the campaign mode to learn how to play, and I had picked up the concepts and whatnot within the first 100 turns. I then started a 'sandbox' style game, played long enough to lose a moderate force to a goody hut and tried to load an autosave and the game crashed. So now I am writing a review. The GUI needs patching in this game, several times I noticed stuff from behind the book window thing superimposed with it, nothing major. It SEEMS to me that the game WILL need patching, and if you happened to pirate it, you will not be getting the patch for quite some time, since it is a Stardock game ( you have to patch it with their steamoid Impulse software thingy.)    I recommend this game highly, if you like turn-based strategy games like Civilization 4 or Age of Wonders, this game is for you.",Elemental: War of Magic

The story centers on Detective David Tapp who awakens in a decrepit, abandoned asylum.  He has been captured by his longtime nemesis, Jigsaw. Obsessed with catching this serial killer, Tapp’s mission has consumed him and ruined his family, resulting in divorce, mental imbalance, and abandonment. Worse yet, this frantic hunt destroyed Tapp’s career while he watched his long-time friend and partner get killed by one of Jigsaw’s traps.  Now Jigsaw has the upper hand and has captured the detective. Tapp must play a deadly game - the likes of which he has been investigating for years - to escape, and in order to do so he must survive the lethal traps and puzzles that Jigsaw has put in place for him and others.

Adventure|General|General|,"Jan  2, 2001",58,In Utero,DreamCatcher Interactive,8.0,E,"A game first played while I was 10 years old and never came to an end. The game's power was enough to drive me to play it again after two decades and help Heritius fulfill its task. Find Ulysses and recover its name, after the gods playing strange games with him. While this game could be huge and write history, for some reason developers choose to let it be, something more close to a regular adventure game. The concept of Heritius it's prototype, all the characters, allies and enemies well-desinged, with epic dialogues and very good acting that captures your attention(i fall in love with the scenario). But there are some disantvantages. The whole game doesnt take too long to beat. If you skip dialogues, you can beat it even in less than an hour. In fact, dialogues are these which give  some more duration. Next, is the fact that you have to be in the exact position in irder to move ,or to grab something. Moreover, if you dont press the right button, you'll see yourself making cycles and wandering...like Ulysses. Besides that, I have to point that the game is full of glitches which in some cases may be fun,but in some others you 'll see yourself stick in a vacuum without getting killed , but without being able to escape from, which puts you in a position to be very careful with your saves (which clearly is a huge boost for the game, as it lets you save whenever and wherever you want,by giving you 30 slots too). The challenges you meet are interesting and the puzzles really addictive, but could clearly be more. No Sirens, no Scylla and Charybdis, no island of Faiakes, no battles in the palace with your long-lost friend and Tylemachus against suitors, no encounters with gods (besides Poseidon). Stuff that would really change the game. Overall, I'd give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, not because it is a mediocre game, but because it could be something much better, but the developers didnt even try make to be.

Each race brings something new as you try winning the race by using any of the strategies or switch between them during the race. The key factor in the game is the SCORE. You collect score while racing. Every stunt that you perform will award you with a certain number of score. Hitting objects, driving fast, drifting they all give you a certain number of score. When you reach 1000 you can burn away your score as nitro thus getting an edge over the others. If you are in the lead you can hit more objects thus gather more score. However hitting objects may cause you to make a mistake and crash into something that is immovable. If you can be patient and gather more than 2000 score, your nitro will be even stronger. Another tactic is to select one of the super cars which are fast and have a good traction. In this case you won't gather that much score but most probably you won't need it because you don't need nitro to stay ahead. Another way to win is to gather your score and never burn it since at the end all score points are converted to time and is subtracted from your overall time and you may jump ahead the winner.",Ignite

It is a nice side story with new enemies.  The story is simple you have to take bacjk Omega and kill everyting  in your way. That is for my 8 out of ten.  Despite this, I was expecting more and I was a little bit frustrated to see that the adjuvant plot was not more relevant.  The other thing I disliked is the F****** ambiguity about the Indocrination theory, in Leviathan you seem to get controlled by the levianthan and you finish the DLC by admitting having a headache, wich is a sign of indoctrination.  In Omega, sweet nothing... I was expecting some clues in either direction.  If the Indoctrination theory is not true then why can they just say so... I am sick of their no comment attitude despite what looks like solid evidence.  God dammit... I don't even care if the true ending is what we saw, I don't like it and if it's that way I want to get over it and wait to see what they' will come up to with ME4.  The reason I am giving an 8 is because I  don't want to pollute the rating (like ME3 deserve 0 lol) because I am pissed of at the ending.  The DLC is good it deserve a 8 or a 7.

All-new classic movie moments complete the Star Wars Battlefront II experience, as players battle within the interior of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia’s blockade runner, the Tantive IV, as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope. In addition, at certain key moments within the battles, players can feel the Force as a Jedi. For the first time ever, Star Wars Battlefront II players can engage in space combat and, during the same battle, board enemy ships to attack from within. Starting on foot inside a capital ship, players can enter the spacecraft of their choice and travel into space to dogfight with the rival faction. From there, they can dock within the enemy’s capital ship, overtake the ship’s command posts, man its turrets to disable its shields and destroy it from within! Or, they can simply stay inside their own capital ship and defend it from attacks and enemy fire. The choice is theirs. The stellar online play that marked the original Star Wars Battlefront returns even bigger and better for Star Wars Battlefront II. Players can locate their buddies and track their stats as they battle alongside more players than ever (up to 24 on PS2, 32 on Xbox, 64 on Windows). [LucasArts]",Star Wars: Battlefront II

There you’ll encounter the characters and creatures of myth and folklore, and find much needed resources to expand your village whether it be iron to make weapons or a mystic tome to entice a great mage to join you. Should your forays meet with success, fame, fortune and prosperity await. But you must take care, for even the loss of a lowly farmer can spell disaster when harvest time comes. Can you build a vibrant settlement, lead your people to prosperity, and tame the wild Hinterland? [Tilted Mill]",Hinterland
Strategy|Turn-Based|Tactics|,"Mar 23, 2018",65,AurumDust,AurumDust,7.9,M,"It is like Banner Saga a mixture of a strategic RPG and survival management. However it improved the gameplay formula with some great additions. The mixture of this made a challenging gameplay with lot of hard decision. Also the art style, soundtrack and graphics are excellent and enhance the immersion. I must admit that many say and criticize that it is nearly a 1 on 1 copy of Banner Saga or even outright plagiarism but I say this is a good thing as the Banner Saga is truly excellent and the game has its merits. The story of the game is written by Russian author Sergey Malitsky. I did not know him before but this awakened my interest for his works. It is presented like a visual story and you have to make decisions that can have anything from minor to critical results. It is set in a world named Terminus which has medieval technology and magic exist but not in large amounts. After a flashback several hundreds years ago where a group of immortal warriors stopped an apocalyptic event called “The Reaping” by sacrificing themselves the story starts. It focus on the travel of three groups as a new apocalyptic event seems to start (I am vague to avoid spoilers). There is the retired guard captain Thorn Brenin and his daughter who are forced into a journey, then there is the healer / scholar Hopper Rouley who is more than it seems and finally the assassin Lo Pheng who is a member of an ancient order. Those 3 and their allies will be deciding the fates of the world if they survive. The story has branches and it is not granted that all characters will reach the final. The story is well written and interesting. I was invested into the characters, lore and world. I must remark that you will not get all answers immediately as the characters themselves do not know the reasons behind the events. At the end you will have answers but also other questions (Set up for a sequel and other motives existing as well). My only critique here is the translation (German version) which is not good. The English version is better. Gameplay: You travel on routes you can chose to your destination. Depending on them there are events, battles, decisions and other things. I like to have more options than in Banner Saga and it feels good. A key element are gems called Strixes. These protect you and you should avoid to run out of them. This can lead to some hard decisions. The events, choices and different routes are to my fullest liking and improved this in comparison to Banner Saga. The battles are turn based and require strategy. Each side has alternating turns no mater the numbers but you can chose the order. Example you have 6 characters so after 12 turns you have used every character once. Like I said the order depends on you as you cant use a character again before all of your others have acted in this turn too and ended the round. This is dangerous when you have spared the most powerful enemies until the end. Each character has abilities you can use. There is a resource called energy that is mandatory for some abilities but also can be used for extended movements. You gain experience through battles and can learn and improve abilities. There are some interesting options and character variety. Don't expect to completely change a characters role. There are magic cards you can use. The better the later you can use them as there are minimum rounds for activation. Those can be won or bought and mostly are in multiple parts you have to collect. Some are pretty useful. I nearly forgot that downed characters in battle are injured and have lowered stats. I costs time to recover and Strixes. There is more like items, moral and loyality but you will get used to this. Like I said there are branches including multiple endings and you can fail in small and big situations. Some decisions are better than others. Presentation wise the game is excellent. The art style is amazing and the graphics enjoyable. The visual novel style works really well. The soundtrack was even better. It impressed me multiple times during my playthrough. There are some negatives: The already mentioned poor translation (German version only), the story could be told a bit better (reveals faster done)  and a few bugs I encounter like minor control problems. Overall this was still a 10/10 for me. I liked the Banner Saga and this is pretty much a carbon copy. The characters, lore and gameplay won me over.",Ash of Gods: Redemption

The sheriff, the banker, the station master and the others all work for the same boss, which means that Fenimore won't be able to count on them, in fact just the opposite, he'll have to take them all on. There's just one person apart from Fenimore on the farmers' side and that the wicked Starek's own niece, a beautiful girl called Rhiannon, who works, against her uncle's wishes, as teacher of the farmers' children.

Action Adventure|General|,"Jul 12, 2018",68,Multiverse Games,Multiverse Games,7.2,None,"Awesome game (reviewed v. 1.1.0.8) - but it's VERY important to spend time optimizing (in-game) settings, or the game may be unplayable. The game's graphics menu does not allow beyond super-sampling (SS) 1.2 (SS is called resolution in the game). Using an oc'ed GTX 1080 the game runs at (usually) 45 fps using SS 1.2, no antialiasing and all other settings maxed (including textures set to Ultra) - and the good old Forceware 385.24 :-) But SS 1.2 is very blurry. Note that the game defaults to SS 1.0 everytime you load a scene or die (even if it still says 1.2 in your settings), needing you to constantly reapply a higher SS value than 1.0. Only lowering resolution increases performance, other settings like LoD, textures and shadows have no effect on frame rate. A GTX 1080 (Ti) is required for 90 fps SS 1.0 - or 45 fps SS 1.1 or 1.2. 45 fps SS 1.6 will probably require a GTX 1180 ;-) There's also a serious error causing the Tray Tool SS value to be multiplied with the in-game SS value. So SS 2.0 (global) in Tray Tool + SS1.2 set in-game resulted in SS 2.4 in-game and totally crashed the game - so beware! I tried to set textures to high instead of ultra and had a hard time seeing any difference. At first textures don't look that good, but when you get close a layer of extremely detailed textures becomes visible - I've never seen more detailed textures, but again - it's only visible when you're a few inches away from the texture. The game is a system hog - much more demanding than for example Lone Echo, Robinson, Doom VFR and Mage's Tale. The ground often looks tesselated - this could explain the extreme hardware requirements. Controls are great, you have options of full locomotion, teleport and more - and there's smooth turning (or angled and more). Your inventory is elaborate reminding me of FallOut 4 VR. Like in Subnautica I needed water and food, and craft items; there are nice light-weight RPG-elements included. This isn't a simple first person shooter, it's an amazing sci-fi experience!",Seeking Dawn

Instead of putting out the lights with a whip though, you are trying to light each one in each room (and no whip is involved). The game is a 2D platformer wherein you work yourself through a maze of rooms fighting enemies, earning XP and picking up objects. After working yourself through a particular part of the map and fighting a boss you'll find the key to a new part of the map with new rooms to explore and new enemies to fight. The game has a strong RPG element in it, which is the thing that ties the whole game together and makes it so addictive. When you earn enough XP you get to distribute points in a number of skills. When the game begins you start with a number of weapon skills (which determine the level of the weapon you can wield), a skill that determines your hit points, a skill that determines the level of potions you can brew, and a skill that determines the level of armor you can wear. Later in the game, after completing certain quests, you learn the ability to cast certain spells (e.g. you learn the skill to cast fire spells). The spells are powerful but require ingredients which are found by defeating certain enemies. The story is intentionally cliche and is told with a good helping of humor through the eyes of the protagonist (a Dungeons & Dragons player who is whisked away to the evil castle the game is set in). It is also full of references to games and movies which are littered throughout the dialog. All in all a great, very addictive game which I can definitely recommend.",Unepic

The Napoleon wars changed Europe for good, leading to the formation of empires and putting an end to almost a thousand years of constant strife between small states that had shattered Europe. The game provides mass-scale battles between thousands-strong armies of the nations involved in conflicts during this period. The theatres of operation introduce France, Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia, Egypt and three nations not represented in the original game – Spain, the Grand Duchy of Warsaw (Poland) and the Confederation of the Rhine. The developers did their best to reconstruct the largest battles and historical events of the Napoleonic wars. The game reconstructs in detail the soldiers' uniforms, weapons and architecture of each nation. Each nation's army has its unique units and possibilities. The game includes over 180 units, 190 buildings, and 1200 flora and fauna elements. When developing the combat system, the peculiarities of early 19th century warring were taken into account, as was the value of formations, provisions and troop morale. Tactical tricks utilized by military commanders of the time are fully reflected in the game.

What I thought sets it apart from modern adventure games is its minimalistic user interface. Just hover your cursor over something and see if any action is allowed. If it is, figure out which item to use. There are no item descriptions, almost none protagonist in-game narration, no tutorial, no game options or explicit hints. The game just isn't holding your hand all the time but on the other hand, most of the puzzles aren't overly difficult and some of them are quite clever. However, you might get stuck on some pixel hunting several times. Story-wise and technologically, the Last Sanctuary (D:LS) is a direct continuation of Dracula: Resurrection, which was a much shorter game. I found the rendered backgrounds diverse and of very good quality even if the resolution wasn't very high. Voice acting was decent for most characters and sound effects and ambient music were quite fitting to set the atmosphere. Most of the story is told through animated cut scenes. Understandably, the animation is stiff for today's standards and some of the dialogues are silly but overall, the pace of the game is maintained with very few distractions. A new thing in D:LS as compared to its predecessor are the quick-time events, which are quite refreshing in an adventure game and also you can't easily predict them so saving your progress regularly is recommended.

Simulation|Flight|Civilian Plane|Civilian Plane|Civilian|,"Nov 30, 2000",69,Laminar Research,Xicat Interactive,5.8,E," It is long past time that someone creates something that is close to the game category, where kids can at least learn a little of something useful, instead of wasting so much time with something that is not real and has absolutely no benefit. I just bought X-Planes 8, and it seems they are starting to add a few game like features, but at the same time have realistic features, which can actually be used to learn how to fly a real plane. It is probably harder to use, but to me, wasting time trying to learn what room has the prize can take just as long, and you end up with no real useful knowledge. Now that X-Planes has the sim accuracy down pat, and 100s of avid fans adding 1000s of new planes to the already long list of real and not so real planes that you can fly, with real topography of the whole plant in the works, they seem to be branching out to give the gamers something they like too. It is a short step from here to having the cities, buildings, etc. from the satellites, such as were used on earthviewer.com and now on google.maps.com, so that you can fly past your home, land on the closest airport, or use a chopper or Harrier to land in your back yard. This may sound far fetched, but just give it a few years :) I have flown many games sims, and you loose interest after a few flights, because the goal is to reach a high skill level that is unrealistic, and one that very few gamers ever reach, unless they spend more hours than is required to learn everything about a real plane. With X-Plane, unless you are brain lazy, you will never reach that boredom state, because just learning all about only one of the 1000s of possible planes can be a career by itself, and when you are done you have learned something real and useful. But game makers hate sims like this, because if you are spending so much time learning anything, they loose the sales of the next wave of games :) It is better to keep spending hours and money to feed you appetite, or spend only the hours, and have something useful?",X-Plane

It has been three years since Catherine de Médicis' rule as regent came to an end, but she still holds the reins of power, making her the target of repeated attacks from the French nobility. One day in March 1566, when she realises that she has fallen victim to a terrible curse, she turns to her doctor and astrologer, Michel de Nostre-Dame, better known as Nostradamus. Unfortunately, the famous prophet is too old and weak to take on such a mission alone. Refusing to abandon his queen in her hour of need, he sends his daughter Madeleine in his place. However, there is no such thing as women astrologers, let alone women doctors in medieval times. To be accepted as such, the young woman must go in disguise and assume her younger brother's identity, César, who is away for some time. Alternating between Madeleine the young woman and Madeleine disguised as César, players are plunged into a thriller where political scheming and ancestral prophecies are intertwined.

Historic|Strategy|Turn-Based|General|,"Sep  1, 2015",70,Koei Tecmo Games,Koei Tecmo Games,8.2,T,"A turn based strategy game worth playing hundreds of hours with deep gameplay mechanics and lot of strategic options. Be warned it takes a bit of time (and research) to get into the game and to understand the well balanced mechanics. Nobunagas Ambition is a long running series of strategy games that started 1983 and is nearly unknown outside of Japan. You play as a Daimiyo (Feudal Lord / Prince) in the Age of the Warring States (Sengoku period) of Japan. In this time Japan was split into many principalities ruled by different clans who want to unify Japan. Gameplay: You chose a scenario during the Sengoku period, then a Clan (Huge variety in size and power) with its Daimiyo. Now the struggle for power begins. Each turn is a full month. As in real life you need retainers (Samurai) to help you. Each retainer (and Daimiyo) has different stats and abilities. Some are only good at warfare others are good at construction or agriculture and there are all rounders. The more famous Samurai / Daimiyo / Retainer have better stats and some have unique abilities. Stats will improve on a learning by doing base and abilities can be learned on the same base. Depending on your Clans size you have a number of action points you can use for upgrades and improvements (The higher the better) which will increase as your clan and “Sphere of influence” grows. For the basics stuff: For each City you control you chose to improve agriculture, commerce or military power. But be careful because these are connected. You can not start a war without provisions (agriculture). As Napoleon said: An army marches on their stomachs”. You can not muster all your soldiers and if you run out of supplies they will starve. Also without commerce (gold / money) you will also be underpowered or lose some options because you can not afford improvements or build stuff. Also as your population grows you can create new districts and build facilities which give you benefits. Important tip: Scout all areas with retainers with a high value for this task (Yes also those you starting in). They often find hidden resource that allows you to build better or special facilities and sometimes hidden paths / roads. You have also a castle or fortress you can improve. The improvements have various bonus effects (some are dependent on the facilities you build in the city) that help you a lot. Then there is the most ignored part, the roads. As you improve the roads above level 2 your cities will grow faster and you earn more money with commerce (Improves with each level. Max is 5 or 3 in mountain areas). Then there are the diplomatics task. You can send your retainers to scout (enemy)areas, secretly recruiting enemy retainers (Can join, betray former Daimiyo during battle or even join with their city in case of higher ranked ones. But only if they are discontent enough!), gather influence in tribes (Smaller clans that give all kinds of support), start diplomatic relations with other clans (Alliances give military support, support in negotiations with other Clan, marriage alliances etc.) and negotiations with the imperial court. The imperial court is also an underestimated mechanic. If you have enough influence you can force a truce on one enemy (not in a coalition ware fare!). Good option if you conquered enemy territory but could not stop their counter-attack fast enough to prevent losing that territory. Now you can prepare many rounds. Alternatively you can get courtesy titles (Need an increasing bribe / fee for each) that improve some stats which can be given as reward to retainers (increase loyalty) or as gift to other Daimiyo (Improve relations for a short time). There are also merchants were you can buy / sell supplies, buy horses and muskets (improve fighting strength) or get treasures with can also be used as rewards / gifts. Finally there are general polices that give benefits in some area and drawbacks in other (You must meet the requirements and pay money each turn for them) For the battles: You chose a Retainer as leader and optional up to 2 supporting Retainers (Always use 2 supporters as it improves your fighting strength) in each City. Then chose your troop size (Depend on availability and supplies), if you want supply them with muskets and horses and finally chose a target. As I said before you can not afford to be in war all times because it will drain your supplies fast (Except your clan has reached a size so big that it can support it). There you can use pincer attacks or pre build fortification if you planned in advance. Tip: I often won by distracting enemy armies with attacks on other Cities while blocking the parts to my main targets.

You decide the role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge for humanity. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more. A man-made floating city called the Ark, made up of hundreds of separate floating islands, is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental self-sufficient and 100% ""green"" habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth's oceans has forced the Ark to become a refuge for humanity.  Crammed with the original Ark founders, their descendants, as well as tens of thousands of refugees, the Ark exists in total isolation from the rest of the world. With 25 years of social unrest, the inhabitants of the Ark have reached their breaking point. It's up to you to decide the future of the Ark and the human race. Blurring the Lines Between Offline and Online - Advance your character’s development across every gameplay mode: single player, co-op, and multiplayer. Gain experience points that you can spend on customizing and upgrading your skills and abilities, designing an entirely unique look and feel for your character. Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you're used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and takes advantage of a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do. Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You'll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success. Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics. This competitive lead on the squad-combat genre helps thrust players into the gritty reality of the Ark's epic secluded arcology. [Bethesda Softworks]",Brink

Action|Simulation|Flight|Flight|Combat|,"Mar 17, 2009",70,Ubisoft Romania,Ubisoft,7.2,T,"Tom Clancy's HAWX (high-altitude warfare) promises to revolutionize the way players think about combat in the sky. The story begins in the year 2012. As the era of the nation-state draws quickly to a close, the rules of warfare evolve even more rapidly. More and more nations become increasingly dependent on private military companies (PMCs), elite mercenaries with a lax view of the law. The Reykjavik Accords further legitimize their existence by authorizing their right to serve in every aspect of military operations. While the benefits of such PMCs are apparent, growing concerns surrounding giving them too much power begin to mount. The Enhanced Reality System is the backbone of the HAWX flight experience: radars and incoming missile detection, anti-crash system, damage control system, tactical map and information relay, and weapons trajectory control. E.R.S. also allows players to issue orders to their squadron, making this system as iconic to HAWX as the Cross-Com system is to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. Players can ease into their flight missions and gain a level of comfort with the use of the assistance mode. Once employed, players can take full advantage of their technological support through the E.R.S and gain maximum piloting security. If the situation calls for the player to unleash the full potential of the aircraft, the assistance mode can be switched off and all safety features will be deactivated. For the first time ever in the air-combat genre, players can experience the entire solo campaign in four-player JUMP IN co-op mode. In PVP mode, players can challenge up to 15 friends in intense dogfighting sessions and find out who's the top gun. Winning players are rewarded with experience points and money to unlock more weapons. Players have the opportunity to take the throttle of over 50 of the world's most famous aircrafts, as well as being able to dogfight over realistic modern landscapes that have endured years of post-war trauma.

The Army Controller interface appears unobtrusively on the screen. Players can view all of their units at a glance and have general awareness of each unit's health, danger, activity and level-up capabilities.  Using the Army Controller, players can select several units consecutively, even if they are spread across the map, in just seconds by simply marking the unit icons in the Army Controller. In ParaWorld's robust single-player campaign players get to know and play three different tribes  -- the Norsemen, Dustriders and Dragon Clan. Each tribe is based on a different ancient culture and each sports its own unique play style, units, architecture, skills, and controllable beasts.

In a disorganized and ghostly city, those foolish, desperate, or unlucky enough to walk the streets lay prey to Britain’s most elusive predators: the vampires. Emerging from the chaos, a tormented figure awakens. You are Jonathan E. Reid, a high-ranking military surgeon transformed into a vampire upon his return home from the frontline.  Explore the darkly atmospheric streets of early 20th century London, and interact with a multitude of characters with their own identities and importance. Accept and fulfill the missions they give you, but don’t forget: sooner or later, you will have to feed, and make a difficult choice... who will be your prey? Absolutely all characters in the game are potential victims of your vampiric lust. Carefully study the habits of your next victim, his or her relationships with other characters, and set up your strategy to feed, unnoticed: seduce them, change their daily habits, or make sure they end up alone in a dark street…  Be careful who you choose to hunt, as they will be gone forever, and their death will impact in a meaningful way the world that surrounds you. Feeding on human blood will not just keep you 'alive;' it will also unlock new vampiric powers to use. [Focus Home]",Vampyr

Action|Platformer|2D|,"Sep  9, 2014",73,Double Fine Productions,Double Fine Productions,5.3,None,"I wanted to start of by saying Hack 'n' Slash has the incredible concept and art direction which I have come to expect from Double fine studios. When I first heard about Hack 'n' Slash, it was during Double Fine's in house ""Amnesia Fortnight"" game jam. The amnesia fortnight is a tradition of double fine which has brought on some really interesting games such as costume quest, the cave, and space base. While I will admit the tradition can be frustrating when it breaks up a team working on a larger game like ""Broken Age""(which may have been inspired by past game jams), thus slowing production, however the fortnight event keeps the creativity in their studio flowing and provides motivation for the designers to keep making inventive games for us to enjoy (so we should promise not to complain). The Game itself is a legend of zelda-esque dungeon puzzler, but instead of the ever-present block pushing puzzles which are so indicative of the genre it is made up of puzzles based off of lua script coding. According to the developers, the game is still a little bit of a work in progress, given the complaints of difficulty on the later portions of the game I feel that this statement is corroborated. The latter half of the game has a steep increase in difficulty of code primarily due to the open-ended-ness of the game itself. While it may sound like lazy coding, the designers still wanted to keep the open endedness and difficulty to foster a community rather than hinder it. The intent of the game is to bring together veteran-coders, fledgling designers and script kitties to create a community similar to that of any game design group to foster creativity and modification to take what is already there and make something more. I personally feel that if t succeeds, this game will be an important point in gaming history when developers learn to let their audience collaborate with them on an even deeper level. I give this game a high review for aiming high, and suggest it to anyone even slightly interested in any form of programming. I want as many people as possible to play this game so that the community can grow and build something history-making out of something already beautiful.",Hack 'n' Slash

As our economies and our way of life tumble into chaos, the superpowers clash to gain control. Set in a fictional future based upon the headlines of today, F.O.W. brings players into the world's next great war. As society succumbs to a worldwide energy crisis, a new global depression takes hold. Amidst this desperate backdrop, two superpower alliances emerge. Join the battle on the frontlines of tomorrow as the Western Coalition (U.S./E.U.) or the Red Star Alliance (Russia/China). Tomorrow's weapons, today: As depicted in F.O.W., the U.S./E.U. and Russia/China have combined their military research and budgets, and the result is over 60 next-gen vehicles and weapons inspired by military designs for the near future. This includes remote controlled drones, gun cams, and next-generation counter-measures systems, all of which are player-controllable. Use high-tech combat systems to collect and relay recon, targeting, and threat information between team mates. Target acquisition and sharing between vehicle occupants is just one example of F.O.W.'s focus on an advanced team play experience. The customization system allows players to grow their soldier to fit their play style by choosing a weapons loadout, as well as a technical specialization (role). As the game progresses each role will upgrade, providing advanced equipment and abilities. The system is a mix of RPG-like depth but with the accessibility of a fast-paced FPS. Frontline combat system: The main game mechanic featured in F.O.W. in both in single player and multiplayer, is the ability to join the forces on the front line. This front expands across large portions of a mission and will require a strategy to achieve the contextual objectives in order to move this front forward. Not only does this system keep the battle centric and players in the midst of the action, it gives a unique sense of advancement as your Division is rewarded with territory for their victories. Choose your path to victory: Within the front, players can take advantage of a sandbox of destructible elements and various weapons of war to create their own unique paths and strategies. Instead of failing and re-playing the same sequence of events, players can 'chip-away' with varied approaches, allowing diverse missions with high replay value. [THQ]",Frontlines: Fuel of War

Fear not,   gamers, for Action Henk is one of the best games I've played yet. It's perfect for the perfectionists who will not stop until they get the best time they possibly can, and makes a wonderful party game to play with friends. The controls of this game can be summed up as a run button, a jump button, a slide button, and a ""hook"" button for certain levels. As simple as these controls may be, they play smoothly and enjoyably, and are fine-tuned in such a way that even a millisecond delay in pressing a button can greatly impact your run. I will warn you, however, that this game is a challenge; sure, you could easily pass most of the levels, but achieving all the medals takes 100% of your concentration. And if going for the gold isn't enough for you, you can reach for the rainbow medals. which can only be obtained by the community's most elite. The graphics are the perfect blend of quality and aesthetics, and the game almost always performs at a lovely 60 FPS. The art style reminds me a lot of Toy Story (though some of the figurines look absolutely horrifying), and the environments welcome players (or frighten them, as the game gets more difficult).

The ability to not only read a pass, but to be one step ahead and to know what is needed to gain yards on an encroaching defender. Trueball Tech allows the player to trap or knock on a pass using the analogue stick with detailed bar-centric physics determining the weight shift of the player and the height and speed of the pass, as to how the player's body will automatically shape to receive it. The Pro Evolution Soccer series has long since treated the ball as an individual entity, allowing the player huge amounts of freedom to pass into space, run on to a knocked-on counter, or produces short triangular passes to make space. Trueball Tech adds even more freedom, with full 360-degree control within several yards around the player and the ability to shield the ball from opposing players, use deft controls to wrong-foot them, and intuitive methods to master close control.",Pro Evolution Soccer 2014

There are 3-4 of them who were too hard because they rely on guessing more then deduction or hints. They were really annoying. I found the level without weapon refreshing, and you had to think how to kill the enemy. I would have prefer another section like that then a bad teleport puzzle.

You have 4 characters with 4 differents sets of powers, and each of them can trigger doors and access, etc...You have totems that permits teleportation (that's very practical) and switch characters. The camera is not well centered (too high), which obligate you to memorize some layout, jump blindly or not see some ennemies. The save system is primitive, there is only one save and no possibilities to go back to an older one (to date). Apart that everything works well. You do have some backtracking to do, but it still fun. Not everything is explained but you can follow the objective pointers. there is a bit of guessing to do on where to go next, but that's part of exploration.

The characters and worldbuilding were interesting, the execution was enrapturing, and if not for the most glaring issues it could've been something to rival the Phoenix Wrights and Danganronpas of the world. First and foremost; it's short. The game costs 1/3 of the price of the average AAA title but a decently astute player can clear it in two hours and still be in Steam's refund frame. Secondly; the game revolves around rooting out people possessed by demons, and the given list of demons makes it too easy to eliminate suspects that don't display the required motives, contributing to the game's length (or lack thereof). The game is too obvious with the story it tells, pulling down the mystery element too much despite it being the game's main selling point. Since it's more of a visual novel, there's little replay value to speak of but while other similar games make up for this by giving players dozens of hours of mysteries and character interactions, this game fails miserably. Lastly, the ending twist ends up making the world less interesting when you leave it than when you came in, and I cannot imagine a greater failure of storytelling.

Can't find any fault with this game, perhaps i could say that there are ver yslight adult themes in the game but not really enough and it feels a little childish (it appealed to the child still inside me) but there is small amount of swearing means in my view it isn't meant for children.

I first played the demo for Ps3, but the frame rate ruined it for me. I always wanted to buy the Pc game on release, but the Pc version was delayed, and at my local game shop they told me it was cancelled. I still had hopes the Pc version would still be released, and to back that feeling up, i bought the Ps3 version, knowing i wasn't going to like it, but the main reason was, to back Sega up on this one. I installed the Ps3 version played it once, and put it on my shelf. But then there was February the first,  I bought the game through steam, at a little discount, but still felt i was ripping Sega of, because i truly love this game  Its awesome  (I do have to say i owned the Master System through to the 32X, so you know, there's a little bit of nostalgic reasons here)  I like every aspect of the game, it runs incredibly smooth on my system, the frame rate is buttery smooth, (I just had to use this saying once) the graphics sharp and crisp, (turn blur off) the sound great, music really fitting and uplifting. Games like this make me truly happy, and thankful for the fact i can still play games like this. I really laugh and smile allot when playing this game, but once i putt down my controller, my grumpy face sacks back, and my depressions kick back in again :D Times are hard... I Really would like to say to the Pc community, please buy this game  If you like race and or kart games, it's brilliant  I know there's allot of pirating in the Pc community, i did it allot my self, and probably will do it again, if they lock the next generation up as they are planning. This generation though, i bought EVERYTHING for my Wii, Ps3, and Pc, if you want to try it, download it, but please buy it if you like it  Games like this should be supported, and i know this game will probably sell like S**t, but it DOES NOT deserve that. It's absolutely great on Pc  The only thing i dislike about Pc gaming since i went back to it in 2011, after, well... about 13 years, are the damn cheaters. I don't care about offline cheating, i actually like to see what people can do, and how they can alter the game, but please don't cheat online. I well... i think i can say, pretty much suck online, but i don't cheat, i do seem to be pretty good at racing games online though, i think about average, butt i hate it when i suck online, and then lose a lot by cheaters, i don't care if i lose a lot against people who play fair, so please keep the Pc version clean online, so it can be great for everyone. Well... All and all this game rocks, it's recommended to play this game on your tv, with a controller tough, if you have the possibility to do so. I have a 120hz full hd syncmaster, but play the game on my 720p tv at 60fps, on my attic. Gonna play some more now. Game on   And once more, Thanks Sega  You gave me fond child hood memories. O yeah... one more thing, it's the name of the game... It's probably about marketing technical reasons, that they called the first one: Sonic and Sega All Stars racing, and the next one, Sonic  and All stars racing transformed, i know the Sonic name sells, but why not call it Sega All Stars Racing 1 and 2, and just put Sonic on the cover for marketing technical reasons. Just saying...  Well now i'm really gonna play some more  Peace out",Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed

I think this year's Pes2013 is an exceptionally big step forward compared to the editions that came out after the legendary Pes6 (in 2006).. The new Pes game is much more challenging due to the possibility to use 100% manual controls.You can now choose movement in a pass  or tackle urself (like every cm to the left or right and 10000 options from soft to hard) ... this is very challenging and sometimes frustrating but if the ball is given a correct kick it gives often harder and more extreme goals that are very beautiful, satisfying and always unique!! ...... To get this you must first change all controll settings to manual though!.. Pes is the best football game for PC gamers if you ask me. Fifa appears on the console very well the paint to come. The reason why Pes is primarily a PC game is easy to explain: On the PC you can use the patch from the website patchedit.com so the game is absolutely perfect in every detail ... f.e. the hairstyles of footballers are the same as they were this week in the Champions League league... .. and last but maybe most important of all: The graphics get an extreme makeover leaving out the blur and the low detail graphic settings that Konami chooses by default assuming everybody still has a Pentium 4 pc..believe me..the visuals are stunning... when will Konami wake up and open the available eyecandy for the main audience??",Pro Evolution Soccer 2013

It's not in 3d like Trine 3. Storywise, Trine 4 takes place some years/months after Trine 3... that is a fact  proven by something in Trine 4, but I won't reveal where. That's for you to find out. We have a new story involving a prince whose nightmares are overtaking every place he visits. This time our heroes are summoned by the astral academy headmaster to take care of the problem. That's the story. I loved all the references to the previous adventures of our heroes. If you remember previous games, you'll have a smile on your face many times. When it comes to the gameplay, it's basically Trine 2 but with some new mechanics, I love the fairy rope and dream shield the most. With all of our abilities we can now solve most of the puzzles in many ways, not just one. You can also upgrade your heroes, but I've finished the game 100% without spending even a point. That means you can finish the entire game without upgrading anything... it will certainly make the game harder, but if you enjoy the challenge like me then go for it.

The game drops players into heart-pumping racing action with 20 cars on a track all targeting the finish line and battling each other as they trade paint and collect intense power-ups, including the ability to blast other cars out of the way with huge bursts of energy, boost their speed, and more. Gamers can use offensive and defensive attacks as they battle for the lead and careen through real-world track locations ranging from L.A. and San Francisco to the streets of Hackney, UK and the treacherous roads of Barcelona, Spain. Beyond the action-packed racing filled with fast curves, sneaky alternate routes, hair-raising jumps and fully realized damage models that provide for spectacular crashes, Blur’s narrative is presented through Bizarre’s new community-based interface, reaching far beyond the game itself. This unique story-driving social network evolves dynamically as players compete in different races, make new friends, rivals and fans, and connect with other racers both in-game and in real life. Looking beyond Blur's single player story, gamers can engage in competitive and team-based multiplayer races with up to 20 players online, or on a single console via 4-player split-screen. Bizarre has also introduced Blur’s original social gaming experience - Custom Groups, where anyone can create unique multiplayer modes based on their favorite ways to play the game.

The time travel mission goes awry, creating an alternate timeline where technology has followed an entirely different evolution, a new superpower has been thrust on to the world stage, and World War III is raging. The Empire of the Rising Sun has risen in the East, making World War III a three-way struggle between the Soviets, the Allies, and the Empire with armies fielding wacky and wonderful weapons and technologies like Tesla coils, heavily armed War Blimps, teleportation, armored bears, intelligent dolphins, floating island fortresses, and transforming tanks. Red Alert 3 asks the question ""What If?"" What if every bizarre research project and technology experiment for the last 70 years had actually borne fruit? What if the Philadelphia Experiment, time travel theory, teleportation, invisibility, Tesla technology, and a hundred other intriguing research projects had all paid off and gone mainstream? What if the Soviet Union survived and thrived; what would it look like 10 years in the future? What if the Japanese Empire had never fallen and instead became the ultimate high-tech military superpower?  The end result is an imaginative and playful vision of an alternate future filled with possibility. [Electronic Arts]",Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3

I would have liked some choice on pathing so you can actually use your spells for something other than just combat. The initial novelty of using gestures to summon spells wears off fairly fast and actually my favourite weapon - the ice bow - often got mixed with other very similar gestures, making it basically unusable later in the game.

Its a Community Messaging Game. Each game is played on an island where two squads of up to four soldiers battle each other for supremacy. The player takes the role of a military officer, issuing strategic commandings to his / her squad, then watching the resulting battle unfold. Games are started by players sending out Challenges to anybody they know - either exisiting Naked War players in their in-game address book, or real life friends or acquiantences via their email address list. Each player takes it in turn to plan the movement of their four units. Each unit is allowed up to seven 'moves' per turn, and can move, attack, enter buildings, drive tanks and other vehicles or use items, etc., each move. Once the player has set up all the moves for their four units, he / she clicks the send button, which sends an email to their opponent containing this turn (in the form of an attached file), then plays back the turn on their PC, showing both players the results of the planned moves. When a player receives a turn in their email Inbox, they simply double click the attachment to launch Naked War, which plays back the turn received then allows the player to set up their own turn in reply. Each soldier in the game starts with a 'doofer', but looses it to their attacker if the damage inflicted is great enough to 'demob' the soldier, losing their uniform and making them naked! The aim of the game is for one team to defeat the other by gaining control of all the doofers, and the winner is declared at the end of the turn where the last doofer changes hands. Each turn is played offline at whatever time is convenient to the player. There is no need for both players to be on-line at the same time, or playing at the same time. Turns can be replied to instantly, during lunchtime, or at the end of the day, or they can wait in your Inbox for days until the you are ready to respond. The average turns take only a few minutes to set up and play back, and a game can take anything from as little as 10 turns, up to 50 or more before there is a winner, depending on the complexity of the map and the relative skill of the players involved.

Guide your species as it builds (and the player designs) villages, buildings, cities, and vehicles. Along the way to becoming a global civilization you can choose whether to hunt or forage, attack or trade, be nice or play rough.

As you explore and play in this limitless universe of unique worlds, your personal Sporepedia tracks all the creatures you've met and places you've visited. Take complete control of your creature's fate as you guide it through the following six evolutionary phases: Tidepool phase: Fight with other creatures and consume them to adjust the form and abilities of your creature. It's survival of the fittest at the most microscopic level. Creature phase: Venture onto dry land and help your creature learn and evolve with forays away from your safe haven. Carnivore or Herbivore? Social or Independent? The choice is yours. Tribal phase: Instead of controlling an individual creature, you are now caring for an entire tribe of your genetic craftwork. Give them tools and guide their interactions as you slowly upgrade their state of existence. City phase: Bring your creatures' race into a new golden era by building up the technology, architecture, and infrastructure of their city. Civilization phase: Once your city is established, your creatures begin seeking out and interacting with other cultures. You can have them do so with an olive branch or a war cry—either way, the goal for your creatures is to unify the planet.

Effectively it meant immortality, and the Core decreed the process mandatory for all citizens in order to ensure their safety. However, there were many citizens unwilling to toss aside their bodies so casually, many indeed who regarded patterning as an atrocity. They fled to the outer edges of the galaxy, forming a resistance movement that became known as the Arm. War began, though it was never officially declared by either side.

While vehicles were present in the first game, Mass Effect 2 did slightly lack the planet free-roam, which is why the Overlord pack is a refreshing change. It also provides some natural obstacles that the player will need to overcome with the vehicle, such as crossing lava flows and reaching higher locations using steam vents. There are four assignments overall, which does make this pack a slightly longer experience than the previous costing DLC's, around two hours of content, perhaps more depending on the difficulty. The assignments all follow on from each other and therefore all need to be completed in a set order, which is both gripping and intriguing, as each assignment leads you on to the next. There are several Renegade and Paragon dialogue options in the content which will allow the player to tailor make the decisions and outcomes of the final assignment. The Overload DLC doesn't seem to be dependant on the player having completed the final story missions of the main game, so the content could be played before or after, depending on when the player may see fit to start it. Overall the pack is a great edition to the Mass Effect story and is a welcomed addition for any fan of the series. It has beautiful locations and buildings, new, and not recycled from earlier in the game. It is a shame there is only four short assignments as the free-roam planet and vehicle exploration could have led to several side-missions and quests, but all in all, a solid piece of content.",Mass Effect 2: Overlord

But beyond inaccessibility, the games were finally not that good, because even when you figured out the mechanisms they were still too MECHANICAL: not even really worth learning in the end because they were all variations of a sausage machine. However something miraculous happened with Crusaders Kings 2, and echoes of the good things we saw in earlier games (Hearts of Iron 2) reappeared: Better looking graphics. Simpler, yet DEEPER gameplay.  The machine kept churning away but Paradox learned to save us from the worst of it, and the gameplay began to blossom.

What we can immediately pull away from the amazing presentation is the knowledge that a very intelligent developer named ""Barking Dog Studios"" saw the potential for the series and worked very hard to make it a better experience all around.  If anyone hasn't played Homeworld in a while, you'll remember that it had a fantastically executed story held back just a smidge by occasionally buggy fleet A.I., a killer difficulty curve after the 3rd mission, an almost unfair amount of frustration at times, and of course some cumbersome interface quirks.  This has really all been cleared up by Barking Dog, since not only have they patched and filled some of the irksome frustrations of the interface, but they've completely cleaned up the issue with unit balance as well.  Incorporating a unit cap was an incredibly good idea, it adds quite a bit more strategy in when you choose to build your units.  Though this was frowned upon as an overall game-changing mechanic, I thought it made unit preservation that much more important.  And with how much faster paced Cataclysm is compared to its predecessor- it makes a good deal of sense to implement that feature.  Without getting too much into the story, the actual flow of combat is what really drove me to enjoy this game over and over again.  The back and forth of the main factions in game are nothing short of nerve-racking.  Slowly preparing a fleet to do battle with a foe that can reverse your technology and assimilates your ships is terrifying and incredibly interesting.  Working out the balance of your fleet, researching new ways to counter your borg-like foe are all part of the campaign as well as the skirmish modes.  To mention briefly the sound design is nothing short of brilliant, its much more engaging than the original game, though some of the voice work does sound a little goofy initially, overall its very well implemented as well.  The atmospheric soundtrack is back, and though it doesn't feature anything that standouts as well as the first game, it is still very good.  The games engine itself was starting to see some gray hairs unfortunately, so of course it was polished as well as it could be for 2000.  Between the much more involved story line, the pacing of various space battle, the more efficient research and harvesting system- the game easily outdoes 1999's origin tale.  If not by design alone, it certainly features a much more engaging plot that really goes all out in conveying the urgency of stopping your mistake that was born from foolish ignorance.  If you have always wondered what the best ""sequel"" was, this is it, this is the actual ""Homeworld 2"" and their is really nothing like it inside the real time strategy genre.",Homeworld: Cataclysm
