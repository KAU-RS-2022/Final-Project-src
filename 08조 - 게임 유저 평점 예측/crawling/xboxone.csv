In this stealth shooter you play Agent Alekhine, a highly skilled Russian assassin driven by a moral compass that leads you headfirst into a covert operation unsanctioned by the country you serve. Working alongside American CIA agents, your mission is clear - though how you accomplish it is anything but - as the tension of a nuclear standoff grows with each passing minute. In a world where one wrong move could be the end of you, navigating a new direction comes at a price. "
Simulation|Vehicle|Combat|,"Nov 14, 2017",M,Maximum Games,33,Maximum Games,Road Rage,3.3,"I spent a great deal of time playing Road Rash back in the day, and without a doubt it was one of the most enjoyable and satisfying games around in that era. When Road Rage was first announced to say I was excited was definitely an understatement. Unfortunately though this adaptation of Road Rash is simply awful and it never offers you anything that will make you fall in love with it like its predecessors did. The amount of technical issues in the game is way too high and this will already be enough to put a lot of people off, but this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Road Rage’s problems. The riding and combat in the game are simply awful and offer you nothing at all. Riding feels unresponsive and never feels exciting and the combat is even more dull with every weapon feeling the same and never packing a punch to even remotely satisfy you. It does have a bit of variety when it comes to the missions you can take part in, but this is quickly forgotten because the world in which the game takes place in is lifeless and the AI has nothing going for it. They have tried to add a story in the game but this is also a failure and nothing that’s included in the story is memorable at all. The presentation side of the game is definitely hit and miss. I actually quite enjoyed the soundtrack that was present in the game, but when it came to the visuals I was really disappointed because certain areas can look really ugly at times. At the end of the day to say that I was really disappointed with Road Rage would be a massive understatement. The game fails to get any of the basics right, and there really isn’t anything that will make you want to keep playing. Some of the problems in the game are completely unforgivable and without a doubt this game tarnishes the good reputation of the Road Rash series. I can’t stress enough that you should stay away from this game and if you were a fan of the Road Rash series then you will find this game horrifying."
Simulation|Virtual|Career|,"Jun 10, 2016",E,UIG Entertainment,33,Visual Imagination Software,Professional Farmer 2017,tbd,"Watching loading screens, that's what you do half of your time playing this game. Because of this, it takes ages to get somewhere or do something. Slow progress. The pro's are: It's a very realistic game, quite fun to play, OK sounds and really relaxing. But there are way better farming sims out there, so I wouldn't really recommend this one to be honest."

Sports|Team|Baseball|Arcade|,"Mar 20, 2018",E,MLB AM,32,MLB AM,R.B.I. Baseball 18,4.6,"The R.B.I. Baseball series is a series that has struggled quite a lot and that’s mainly down to the amount of problems each game has had. Don’t get me wrong it’s not as bad as some people make out but it also isn’t very good either. Still after all the problems the series has had I was still kind of looking forward to R.B.I. Baseball 18 in a way and I was hoping that they would rectify some of the problems the previous games had, but unfortunately that wasn’t the case. It’s not all doom and gloom though because I think this game is better than the others in a way and there is quite a bit of decent content for you to wade through. I also liked the new mode additions and they did provide me with some enjoyable moments at times which in turn gave the game a little replayability. Unfortunately the problems don’t take long to rear their ugly head and once again you end up having to deal with a bunch of technichal issues which will definitely be off-putting for quite a lot of people. I also found some of the mechanics in the game to be on the awkward side and I especially thought that to be the case when it came to the pitching and hitting aspects of the game. This is a shame because the controls feel great and the simplicity of them means things never get too complicated which is what I want from a baseball game. If you’re one of those people who likes to jump in a game almost immediately then you will find this game to be pretty irritating because the loading times seem to go on forever and this obviously harms the fun factor quite considerably. If you look past the long loading times though then you will find some brief enjoyment here and there and I especially found that to be the case when playing online, and thankfully there wasn’t many problems playing with friends online. The presentation side of the game to my amazement seems to have taken a backwards step and the visuals and sound design are very lacklustre to say the least. I’m also shocked that there is still no commentary because in my opinion this would have given the game a little bit of much needed character. At the end of the day if you left the R.B.I. Baseball series then this game isn’t going to make you want to return back to it. It does get a few things right and there are a couple of improvements but it still has too many problems that strangle the life out the game and when it’s all said and done it just doesn’t do enough to get a recommendation from me unless you re huge baseball fan."

Action|Shooter|Third-Person|Arcade|,"Jul 31, 2018",M,Deeli network,32,Deeli network,Gene Rain,3.6,"Sometimes a game doesn’t have to be AAA release to be a success and I could go on to name a lot of different game’s that proved to be awesome even though they weren’t AAA game’s. I’m always willing to try anything new no matter how big and small it is and even though you associate shooters with having big production costs sometimes the smaller game’s can provide you with some enjoyable and in the end surprising moments. Gene Rain is a shooter that did surprise me a few times during my playthrough and whilst it did suffer with quite a few shortcomings I did appreciate the effort that has gone into certain areas even if it does fall a little short in the end. Obviously the most important aspect in a game of this ilk is its shooting elements and I’m pleased to say that they did very well with these elements. Shooting enemies felt very satisfying and there is quite a bit of fun to be had when thrown into these sections of the game and in my opinion the shooting elements would’ve been even better if the controls were a little more fluid and responsive. Thankfully though I was able to look past the control issues and that was mainly down to the game’s variety. There is plenty of variety present in the game and I found that to be especially the case when it came to the enemies you have to tackle during your playthrough. Even though the game does have quite a bit of variety included in it I would still recommend that you play the game in intervals because it can get a little tedious and repetetive after a while, but this isn’t a major problem for me though because I find I have to do this with most shooters. In terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to get to grips with and in my opinion the length of the game is absolutely perfect and you do get good value for your money. Of course there’s also a story present in the content that’s avaliable to you as well but I found the story to be a little lacklustre and in the end I lost interest in the story quite quickly, which is a shame. Something I didn’t lose interest in though was the presentation side of the game. Don’t get me wrong the presentation isn’t perfect and the cut-scenes are a little dissapointing, but on the whole I mainly enjoyed both the visuals and sound design and I think they both gave the game quite a bit of character. At the end of the day Gene Rain would have scored higher with me if it didn’t have the few niggling and unnecessary problems it has because as far as shooters go it’s not a bad effort at all and in the end it probably just does enough to get a small recommendation from me."

I used the money I got from refunding another game that was just released (really lucky there), even if it was out of spite, I just wanted to give that money to someone else that was undeserving of it but somehow, still more deserving than the first.  The first thing that got me about Ghostbusters was the quality of the CGI introduction, the animation of the characters and that even in 30 FPS it runs far smoother than I expected.  Some other developers should really take note that even in 2016, newer games than this could learn something!"

At least that's the best way I can describe it. You play as a Journalist, that receives a call from The Zodiac Killer making him part of that world. Through a series of ""Living Dream"" therapy sessions you unravel the story. You can play the game in two modes, Serial Killer mode, or Story Mode. Serial Killer mode sounded like the most fun so I went with it first. Don't. Both modes play exactly the same with one difference, in Serial Killer you are hunted by the Zodiac Killer in your dreams. Again, it sounds fun, but it more like annoying. The Zodiacs AI its too sensitive, and can sometimes get you, when it hasn't. When you are captured, you're killed and you respawn. You lose nothing but time, hiding or dying. It felt like he was around too frequently to feel like I had time to do anything.The controls have no dead-zone, leading to drifting and jerky turning, making pointing at small clues a nightmare. I feel like the combination of having the killer and the touchy controls make the game drag on. Story mode allows you the time and lenience to work with the over-sensitivity.  The concept is great, but it doesn't come together well. If you like a decent sleuth game, play this one in story mode."

Action Adventure|General|,"Apr 10, 2018",M,Modus Games,52,Iron Galaxy Studios,Extinction,1.9,"Extinction is a game that I’ve been keeping a close eye on over the last few months and it was a game that I was looking forward to because it did have a unique feel to it. Unfortunately though the game has too many problems and whilst it does have quite a few good points as well it never reaches its full potential because certain issues hold it back quite considerably. When it comes to the combat though I think they get this aspect of the game spot on. The enemies that you come across have lots of variety going for them and tackling them can be a huge amount of fun. I think the main reason why tackling enemies was fun is because the combat elements in the game feel like they pack a punch and because of this taking down an enemy can be extremely satisfying. Unfortunately the world in which the combat takes place is a little on the bland side and in my opinion it just doesn’t feel alive and that does make exploring a little boring. Another reason why the world doesn’t come alive is because the missions that are present in the world are very repetetive and they grow stale quite quickly which means tackling them can feel like a chore a lot of the time. Thankfully though the missions do have a decent story that accompany them and this did make me want to carry on with them but it didn’t hide all of the problems. The most annoying problems that persist are the technichal issues the game suffers with and these issues never seem to go away. They try to keep the frustration levels down by offering a decent difficulty curve but you forget about this quite quickly because the technichal side of the game just annoys you and that’s all you remember in the end, which is a shame. The presentation side of the game disappointed me a great deal and to say I wanted more from it would be a massive understatement. The visuals and sound design just lacked the wow factor and everything about this aspect of the game just felt dated, which in turn harmed the immersion levels somewhat. At the end of the day I can see quite a lot of people being quite disappointed with Extinction and I understand why because a game that is priced quite excessively shouldn’t have as many problems as it does. Don’t get me wrong it’s not the worst game I’ve ever played before and it does provide you with some very enjoyable moments at times, but these enjoyable moments are often littered with technichal issues and these issues harm the fun factor quite a lot. Unfortunately I can’t fully recommend Extinction to you at this time and I would definitely recommend that you wait until it lowers in price before getting it."

The game is very fun and is a must have for anyone looking for a little game to have a laugh at since the dialogue can be quite entertaining. I'm also confused at the severe score set by the reviewer since the platforming isn't bad infact it's quite good though there really isn't much platforming at all since most the time you are using a beam or a shotgun. In all watch some videos on it and if you like what you see I'd definitely recommend picking this title up!

You are in a coma and are tasked with traveling through you own mind and piecing yourself back together so you can wake from this coma. The game asks you a few questions about yourself, like your name and size. As the game moves along you are asked slightly deeper questions. The game uses these questions to name NPCs and enemies to tailor the experience to you. This is a novel idea, but dose little more than decorate the surface. There are four areas of your mind you must traverse. Each area felt the same skinned as a different environment. Everything you do costs neurons, and you can gather them from enemies. There is an issue where you wont be able to kill an enemy because you're put of neruons, but you need to kill the enemy to get neurons. The game also randomizes each level so if you die, everythig you learned about the level has to be re-learned. The missions are all the same, causing the game to start to feel stale long before the 20 hours of play the game boasts. The story is engaging for the most part, but becomes lost to the repetitive nature of the gameplay. Visually Waking is lost, the imagery is stunning, but the blurring effect detracts from it. The final stage left me unable to figure out the chain of events I needed to unfold to finish within the five minute constraint your given, not to mention the layout shifts everytime you die. More could have been done to keep this game engaging."

The game is very reminiscent of classics in the vein of Space Invaders which is quite a compliment even in todays gaming world. Ratalaika Games new release Zeroptian Invasion isn’t a copy cat it simply brings the vibe that many fell in love with so long ago to the current gaming generation standards. Enjoying the game is easy to do because the arcade style gameplay is fun and addictive. As many newer generation gamers never experienced the difficulty designed in the arcade ERA to eat their quarters as quickly as possible, the difficulty here is in place and keep a balance without making it feel unfair as many games did from the arcade ERA. There’s a decent variety of enemies and bosses for you to destroy also in game. The overall presentation of the game keeps gameplay as it should be and in line with my expectations. Zeroptian Invasion is a retro feast in which I strongly recommend it for the value price tag and the nostalgia and fun it provides. Retro fans rejoice!"

Everything in them is there with the souls purpose of pissing the player off. Example! Your weapons will run out and your in the middle of street that is layered with Zombies and I mean caked with the bastards. Thousands of Zombies surround you constantly leaving the player with no breathing room whatsoever.

Action|Shooter|Light Gun|,"Sep 12, 2018",T,Wales Interactive,51,Wales Interactive,Time Carnage,tbd,The controls feel spot on throughout your time with the game which in turn meant the shooting elements in the game always felt satisfying. There are a decent amount of weapons for you to unlock in the game and the best thing is that each weapon feels completely different from the other. I really enjoyed the tactical elements present in the game because you always get a rewarding feeling when you use the right gun for the right enemy. The presentation side of the game does nothing to hold your attention and both the visuals and sound design are a little on the basic side. If played for long periods you find that the gameplay becomes tedious quite quickly because it lacks in terms of variety. There is not enough variety in the way each enemy behaves and there’s also not enough different enemies for you to face. In terms of content the game doesn’t have a lot for you to get to grips with and it doesn’t do enough to keep drawing you back in. Technically the game suffers with a few issues every now and then. Time Carnage originally started out for VR and you can definitely tell that because it has a few teething problems every now and then. This however isn’t Time Carnage’s biggest problem and instead its main issue is that it gets repetetive very quickly because it suffers with a lack of variety in several areas. This is a shame because at times the game can be quite fun because it’s not just about shooting the wide arrange of weapons that are available to you because it also features a tactical side to it as well. Unfortunately though this isn’t enough to make the game as compelling as it should be and the presentation side of the game plays a big part in this because there just isn’t anything that stands out in both the visuals and sound design. This then means that I can’t give Time Carnage a recommendation really because it just has too many shortcomings that ultimately hold it back and in the process stop the game from reaching its full potential.

Action Adventure|Open-World|,"Mar 27, 2019",None,Headup Games,49,Magic Sandbox,Windscape,tbd,"Windscape does a great job of easing you into the quest at hand, (almost starts to slow) in the vain of the Zelda franchise. I never found myself getting bored or frustrated and though the action begins slow I found myself engulfed by the game in a matter of an hours time. Windscape features a style of gameplay that will no doubt be noticed by Zelda fans around the world. It is however not the perfect experience as I did find myself stuck in the environment or a little clumsy several times while engaged in battle. I was captivated by the beautiful presentation and the simple yet compelling visual and sound design were near perfect. I truly enjoyed the story and became even more attached to the characters as the story evolved. The gameplay is a typical action adventure game with crafting elements thrown in along the way. The combat is hindered by the lack of feeling ""in control"" of the character and your weapons at all times and that is my only real complaint with the game. The controls were functional but a tightening of the combat elements and removal of a couple times becoming stuck in the environment while exploring I would have ranked the game higher on the point scale. Despite this though I never seemed to get frustrated and the game made me want to keep playing and enter the next chapter of the saga. Windscape isn’t the best action adventure game I’ve ever played, but it’s far from the worst. In my 1st sitting with the game I planned a 2 hour sit down which turned into 6 hours and finished the game in a total of 3 sittings which means I wanted to play it and never felt like a chore as I was always looking forward to what was next and finding the resources to craft my next weapon or armor. I definitely recommend Windscape if you are a fan of the Zelda formula, there's much enjoyment to be had here and my complaints at the end of the day didn't keep me from enjoying the end experience. In the end there's much more right here than wrong, and I recommend you add this one to your gaming library."

Originally presented as a VR title Unknown Fate is a game that takes you on an immersive adventure and at times it succeeds but unfortunately the issues present in the game suffers with does hold its potential back quite considerably despite it's twisted immersion. The presentation side is extremely vivid, crisp, and the art style very unique as is the immersive sound.  It also provides a mysterious story which brings you in tune with the game events that unfold before you. The problem is that the gameplay feels unfinished and doesn’t help the immersion and instead it hinders you. The puzzles the game offers are solid although easily forgotten because after the puzzles there’s little else present as the enemies you battle in combat is a dull experience combined by lack of depth in the gameplay doesn’t bring enough to the table. I never felt in full control which did throw up a few frustrating moments so, Unknown Fate is basically a mix of good and not so good. It gets about half wrong and about half right. It is a beautiful and unique adventure which give it a bit extra on top of that. I truly feel its biggest weakness is that it was originally a VR title as I stated early on, and it struggled in transition to reality. I will say this in closing I did find the twisted-ness of the game speak clearly to me which I did in fact quite enjoy."

There is nearly no interactivity in the game aside from walking around and talking to the various characters that inhabit this world. The story is gripping and impressively emotional in a way I didn't expect. I feel more could have been done here, a lot more. Even with that said what is presented, is presented well. The price on Xbox is a bit steep I feel for what the game is. I Loved the art style and animation, tho out of sync at times, it added to the overall feel of the game.

The World is in strife from demon armies, and artifacts known as the Tears hold the key to entering this dimension to stop the evil demons and save the world. Pretty standard RPG story. The gameplay doesn't take any liberties or risks either. You control your party, turn based on an open grid. Move, Attack, use Items or Skills. The animations are dreadful slow, and combat happens in real time for the most part, with no ability to fast forward the action. Larger battles can feel so drawn out and cumbersome as the animations are slow and meticulous. At the start you feel powerful, and with this feeling is no reason to grind to advance your characters. Early combat felt like it had zero risk, as you out powered your enemies by a considerable margin. It's a beautifully made game, with a great Anime aesthetic but the ability to speed up the combat would make the game ten times more fun to play."

Unfortunately AO International Tennis failed to hit the mark in several areas so I was hoping that Tennis World Tour would do a bit better. It does do a bit better than AO International Tennis but this game is far from being a masterpiece and it does suffer with quite a few shortcomings, which ultimately hold the game back. It does however get a few things right and I especially found that to be the case with the licensed player’s that are available to you. Playing as them can be quite fun and they’ve done a good job of including each player’s quirks and mannerisms, which is great. Unfortunately though you can’t trully enjoy the players available to you because the controls don’t always remain responsive and sometimes you end up playing shots that you never went for which can be very frustrating. There is also a problem with the hit detection as well and sometimes my player just completely left the ball and this was infuriating to say the least. I can see some people being put off by the game’s difficulty because it can be a pain to finish off and win a game, especially against the top players. I however found the challenge to be pretty decent and when you finally win a tournament or beat a top player you do get a great sense of achievement. You will however have to put up with some unrealistic behaviour from the AI though along the way. The AI plays shots that don’t look real at times and this is not only frustrating but it also harms the immersion levels as well. In terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to get to grips with, but it does need some more. The content also needs more polish in certain areas as well because at times it does play a little rough. Thankfully though the presentation side of the game is not too bad. Visually the game can look decent at times and if more variety was placed into the courts it would be even better. The sound design whilst also good needs a little more variety as well because it can get a bit tedious hearing the same commentary over and over again. At the end of the day Tennis World Tour isn’t a complete failure and it does provide you with some enjoyable moments from time to time, but in the end it just has too many problems at this stage. I will say though that if you want a recommendation about which tennis game you should pick between this and AO International Tennis then I would recommend this, but they’re both a very long way from being perfect."

Action|Shooter|Third-Person|Arcade|,"Dec 20, 2017",T,Good net technology co. Ltd,41,Good net technology co. Ltd,Future War:Reborn,tbd,"We’ve seen quite a few mobile game’s come to consoles recently and most of them haven’t been very good, and unfortunately Future War: Reborn doesn’t set the world alight either. I will say however that this is not the worst mobile ported game I’ve ever played and it does have some good points. The gameplay in the game is actually pretty decent and it does provide some enjoyable moments, but unfortunately it’s very brief. You will notice that the amount of content is pretty lacklustre and there isn’t much replay value to be had here, which will put a lot of people off because the price tag is a little too high for the content you get. There are not many levels for you to get to grips with and that’s probably a good thing because the level design is severely lacking when it comes to variety. There is also a shortage of variety when it comes to the enemies and facing them does become tedious which is a shame because I thought the weapons were pretty fun to use. Something they did get right though was the controls that were implemented. When using these controls you would never think that this game started off on mobile devices because they’ve done a brilliant job of making the controls smooth and responsive throughout. The presentation side of the game is not the best and you can tell straight away that there has been little effort to make it different from the mobile port. Visually the game looks ugly most of the time and there isn’t really much that’s memorable. The sound design doesn’t do much better and in the end it just ends up getting on your nerves. At the end of the day in order to make a mobile port become successful on a console you have to tweak little things to make it look like it belongs on console and in some ways they do get some things right, but unfortunately they also get a lot wrong. Future War: Reborn is a game that’s overpriced in my opinion and I think if they’d have started with a lower price out of gate then the problems wouldn’t have been as glaring. When it’s all said and done this game does provide you with some enjoyable moments but the problems are never far behind so for that reason I can’t fully recommend this game to you."

Thankfully this version does have a few things going for it, but unfortunately it also has a few too many problems which does make it difficult to get fully invested into the game. One of my favourite things about the game was definitely the story, and in my opinion it’s a fantastic story which remains gripping and interesting throughout. Unfortunately though the game does suffer with quite a few technical issues throughout and this does make the story less immersive, which is a shame because the story is so good. The atmosphere does help to combat the technichal issues and sometimes you will forget about them because the creepy atmosphere keeps you glued to the screen, but in the end you still notice the issues. The gameplay is a bit hit and miss, but on the whole the puzzles have been done really well and I found the controls to be responsive most of the time. My only real problem with the gameplay was the hideous camera, and the awkwardness caused a lot of frustration where there didn’t need to be any. I also became frustrated with the amount of loading screens that are dotted everywhere. I wouldn’t have minded as much if the loading screens were quick, but unfortunately they seem to go on forever and it can harm the rhythm of the game. The presentation side of the game is something that I really enjoyed, especially when it came to the sound design. The voice actors have done a fantastic job making the story even more believable and they make you connect with the story even more. The visuals are pretty decent as well, but I would have liked them to have made the game a little brighter. At the end of the day I must admit that when everything was said and done I was a little disappointed with this version of Black Mirror. Don’t get me wrong it does have some very good things going for it, but for the price the game is currently at I would have liked the problems to have been fewer. As it stands at the moment I can’t fully recommend Black Mirror, but once it reduces in price and has a patch or two then it may be worth purchasing."

Whilst Xenon Valkyrie+ gets a few things wrong it ultimately gets more things right and I must admit that I enjoyed my time with the game quite a bit. The gameplay has been done really well and without a doubt it has a very addictive side to it and that’s mainly down to them getting the right balance between being challenging and rewarding. Whilst I enjoyed most of the gameplay I did however find the boss battles to be a little tedious and on the whole they just felt generic, which is a shame. The controls which are very important in a game like this have been done really well and they never gave me any problems, which is great considering the platforming elements can provide you with some awkward moments at times. Don’t get me wrong the platforming isn’t bad by no means it just can be a little frustrating at times. Something that really impressed me about this game was the level design. Each level has had a lot of thought and effort put into it and the amount of variety that’s present in each level means it isn’t a chore to carry on when you die. Unfortunately the same amount of variety isn’t present when it comes to the characters. Each character feels and plays the same and I think that they should have given each character more of its own style to keep things a little fresher, because that in my opinion would make you want to complete the game with each character more. The presentation side of the game is something that I enjoyed quite a bit. Visually the game has a real retro vibe going for it and when you combine that with the decent sound design it makes you enjoy the game even more. At the end of the day Xenon Valkyrie+ is one of them rare games that can be enjoyed playing for long periods and short periods. It may be far from being perfect but the fun factor at times can be off the charts and when all the mechanics combine together perfectly things flow brilliantly. If you’re a fan of this specific genre then you can do much worse than Xenon Valkyrie+ and when it’s all said and done it does enough to get a thumbs up from me."

In terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to get to grips with and the best thing is that the content has variety present in it as well. While the presentation side of the game isn’t going to blow you away anytime soon I actually enjoyed what both the visuals and sound design delivered. Technically the game held up really well throughout and the controls always felt satisfying during every game I played in. This game is best played in short bursts because it does have a tendency to get repetitive quickly. Quite a bit of grinding is required in order to unlock things which does make things become a little tedious after a short while. I found it very difficult to find an online game which is a shame because the game is fun when played online. I’ve seen many top-down combat games before and for the most part it’s a genre that I enjoy, but in terms of innovation this genre is definitely lacking in a few areas. At Sundown: Shots in the Dark however does offer you something different and whilst it does have a few shortcomings the shadow hide and seek mechanic does make things stand out quite considerably. Despite this though I would still recommend that you play the game in short bursts because like every game in this genre it does get repetetive quite quickly. Thankfully though the variety in the content you get does help ease the repetetiveness a little but be prepared to grind quite a bit in order to get some of the content. Once you do unlock the content though there is more than enough to keep you occupied and on the technical side of things the content doesn’t have many if any problems at all. In fact the only real problem for me came from finding a game online. It did take me a while and this did frustrate me because the game is a huge amount of fun when played alone. At the end of the day then if you’re able to look past this game’s slight imperfections then I have no doubt that fans of these types of game’s will find more than enough in At Sundown: Shots in the Dark to keep you satisfied which culminates in a recommendation from me.

While the concept sounds good, the games mechanics are lacking, a lot. I faced foes shooting me through large buildings, and taking damage from unseen sources. It handles well enough at most times, but the movement feels over encumbered, and it hinders the already shaky game play. The plot is thin, with mediocre voice acting, and constant repetitive commentary from the other characters in the game. There is a bit of humor that redeems the constant chatter a little, but becomes bland fast. The combat and objectives are repetitive, and need a bit of diversity. Some of the Bosses were nice concepts, but poorly executed. For a remastered game the graphics and sound both felt unpolished, and scratchy, detracting even more from the immersion. Metal Wolf Chaos isn't a game I would recommend unless You've been after this old XBOX Japanese Exclusive."

Action|Shooter|Shoot-'Em-Up|Top-Down|,"Apr 20, 2018",E10+,Live Aliens,55,Live Aliens,Atomic Heist,tbd,"We have another twin-stick shooter in the form of Atomic Heist and as you already know twin-stick shooters are kind of my go to genre, so you will often find me blowing off a little steam on games like this. As far as twin-stick shooters go Atomic Heist can be pretty enjoyable at times but it’s certainly not the best game I’ve ever played in this specific genre. The first thing I always check in a game like this is how the controls hold up, and thankfully I suffered with no problems here. Everything remained tight and responsive throughout and this without a doubt made the gameplay a lot more fun. The gameplay on the whole has been done really well and the best thing is that it has an addictive side to it, which in turn means there’s quite a lot of replayability present. You will however die a lot in the game and if you easily get frustrated then this game will frustrate you quite a bit at times because it can get a little too difficult and feel a bit unfair at times. The game does however offer you an abundance of upgrades for you to tackle this high difficulty curve, and I must admit that each upgrade impressed me. Every upgrade feels like it matters and the most important thing is that they actually help you so this makes you want to carry on to get them all. Using these upgrades on the enemies never gets boring and the best thing is that there’s plenty of enemies to use them on. Each enemy has a decent amount of variety going for them and they each attack differently which keeps things fresh and interesting for longer. Unfortunately the level design doesn’t have the same amount of variety as the enemies and I must admit that I was a little disappointed with this aspect of the game. Another thing that disappointed me was the presentation side of the game. Visually the game just looks bland and there isn’t really anything that catches your eye here. Unfortunately the sound design doesn’t do much better and in my opinion they’ve missed a trick here because they could have created a lot more immersion when in combat. At the end of the day there’s a huge amount of twin-stick shooters for you to try and I’m afraid that Atomic Heist is going to get lost in the pile. Don’t get me wrong Atomic Heist is not a bad game it’s just that it has a few too many shortcomings and this in the end holds it back. If you’re a fan of twin-stick shooters though then there is content here that will tickle your fancy somewhat and in the end it just does enough to get a small recommendation from me."

I enjoyed the story that was present for the most part because the humor and charming dialogue kept me invested during my time with the game. There’s a decent amount of variety present in the characters that become added to your team as you progress thru the game. The core gameplay elements get repetitive very quickly which does make things become more tedious than it should. I was a little disappointed with the controls in the game because they never felt as tight as they should’ve been. In terms of content there isn’t a great deal for you to get to grips with and the content that is available to you isn’t varied enough. Combat left a lot to be desired in this game because you never feel in full control and it’s definitely not satisfying enough. Most of the mechanics in the game don’t combine together well enough. I appreciate a game trying to be different but sometimes when doing that you can lose the vision and the game ends up failing in some areas. Unfortunately that’s exactly what Away: Journey to the Unexpected does and this in turn makes you forget quickly about the good things the game does. This is too bad, because the story is interesting and funny and the presentation that accompanies the story ticks a lot of boxes. This however is not enough because the gameplay is just not fun enough and any fun it does have is quickly lost due to the game’s problems. These problems range from being too repetetive to controls that simply don’t feel right and the issues don’t stop there. The combat elements fail to pack a punch which in turn makes defeating the enemies and bosses you come across not very satisfying at all. You also have to deal with several mechanics that don’t combine together well enough and the lack of variety in the content makes you forget about the nice and diverse characters that are present. At the end of the day then Away: Journey to the Unexpected just has too much wrong with it and I came away from the game feeling very disappointed because I must admit that I did expect a lot more. Unfortunately then I can’t recommend this game to you because when it’s all said and done there are much better games out there for you to play."

Sports|Racing|Arcade|Individual|Biking|Automobile|,"Feb  7, 2019",E,Curve Digital,53,Yeah Us!,Pumped BMX Pro,4.3,"The presentation side of the game despite lacking from time to time, delivers enough immersive action when it comes to the visuals and sound design. In terms of content there is a decent amount for you to play with and it has enough of a challenge to keep you coming back for more. Technically Pumped BMX Pro is pretty sound for the most part and I didn’t really bump into many problems during my time with the game, other than the odd control set-up remaining from the 1st game. There is a decent amount of variety present when it comes to the levels and this does keep things fresh and interesting for longer. I found the difficulty to be a little too much at times due to the control setup and this did make me become frustrated a bit. The physics sometimes don’t feel as realistic as they should and this does mean the controls suffer at times because of that, sometimes I would skyrocket over a jump others seemed to be perfect jumps and would fall short of the next obstacle. Sometimes the game is a little too basic for its own good and this means that the game doesn’t stand out as much as it could. It’s been a while now since Pumped BMX + released, but I must admit that despite its age I have returned back to that said game a few times for some fun. As you can imagine then I had quite a lot of interest in the new release Pumped BMX Pro and despite suffering with a few shortcomings It did bring along the fun factor as well. The gameplay follows the Trials series in a way and I’m pleased to say that technically it holds up really well for the most part (I'm a huge trials fan btw). The physics though don’t always feel realistic and this can make the controls feel a little fiddly and not as responsive as they should. This then makes the difficulty even more of a problem at times and that’s not a good thing either because the difficulty can be very problematic for me mainly due to odd feeling controls and my mind still has the RT engrained as acceleration. This however didn’t stop me from returning back to the game though and I’m pleased I did because the content has a decent amount of variety with plenty of levels to tackle. I also enjoyed the presentation  side of the game as well because both the visuals and sound design have been done pretty well. At the end of the day then Pumped BMX Pro is one of them games that’s perfect for passing a bit of time every now and then and it does enough to get a recommendation from me. I can't fault it for the controls just because they felt odd for me. Thumbs up!"

The story isn’t perfect in some instances I actually found it to be pretty enjoyable and it did enough to hold my attention throughout. Combining different elements is as fun and enjoyable as ever and in some cases some of the items you have to combine are actually pretty clever. The easy to pick up and play style that’s present in the game means gamers of all ages can enjoy what this game has to offer. When played for long periods the game does get repetetive quite quickly so I would recommend that you play the game in short bursts. In terms of content the game doesn’t have a huge amount for you to sink your teeth into. I enjoyed that the game was quite easy in parts it still would’ve been nice to have been challenged a little bit more every now and then. I love the Doodle God game’s because they never take themselves seriously and they offer you a nice fun and relaxing experience. As you can imagine then I was eager to get to grips with Doodle God: Crime City and whilst it has a few imperfections that hold it back a little it still didn’t stop me from enjoying my time with the game. Once again you have to combine different items to progress through the missions and once again it’s fun doing this when played in short bursts. I recommend that you play the game this way because the gameplay doesn’t have much in terms of depth so it does get repetetive quite quickly. In terms of content the game doesn’t have a huge amount, which is a shame because the story and content it does have has been done pretty well. Another aspect of the game that has been done well is its presentation and without a doubt both the visuals and sound design make the gameplay become quite immersive. At the end of the day then even though it would’ve been nice if the gameplay was a little more challenging and had more depth to it Doodle God: Crime City still does enough to get a thumbs up from me because it’s fun and gamers of all ages can get something out of the game."

Thankfully I enjoyed it in the end, even if it does have a few shortcomings.When I began the game it became quite clear that it's not be the best looking and sounding game ever they’ve still done a good job of capturing the same atmosphere as the films and not sure they were aiming for artistically more than that is present. It would’ve been nice to have heard voiceovers because the story isn’t as captive due to this. In terms of the gameplay it basically features some combat elements with a few puzzles thrown in as well and in my opinion they’ve done a good job with both aspects. The combat always remained fun and the puzzles you come across are clever but not too difficult. I found a certain ""Zelda nostalgia"" present at times. That being said DreamWorks Dragons Dawn of New Riders still does more right than it does wrong and earns a recommendation from me.

Strategy|Turn-Based|Tactics|,"Nov 23, 2018",T,Ripstone,60,Auroch Digital,Achtung! Cthulhu Tactics,tbd,"There’s a decent amount of depth present when it comes to the combat elements in the game and when in full flow this does make you have a rewarding experience. The presentation side of the game surprised me quite a bit because I didn’t expect there to be as much detail as there was in both the visuals and sound design. The story was minimalistic while in some areas I actually found what were available to me to be very well written and ultimately interesting. Strategy plays a big part in this game and I was pleased with how intricate certain strategy elements were. Unfortunately the game lacks in several areas when it comes to variety and this does mean that the game does get repetitive rather quickly. You can’t really explore in the game which means the levels feel a little underdeveloped. I found the RPG aspects to be a little basic and there wasn’t much that stood out here and what it did have has been seen many times before. The World War II and Nazi setting has been done a lot in recent times but for some reason the historian in me comes rushing to the surface and I always look forward to a game that features these settings. Achtung! Cthulhu Tactics features this setting but it puts a bit of a unique spin on things, and whilst it isn’t perfect it does get more things right than it gets wrong. One of the main things this game gets right is definitely the combat because there’s quite a lot of depth present and this does make the combat rewarding in pretty much all areas. Obviously the combat wouldn’t be as good if it didn’t feature a decent strategic side to things and thankfully I’m pleased to say that they’ve got the strategy elements spot on. In terms of problems the game has a few underlying issues and for me the biggest problem was that it lacked in terms of variety. There’s several areas where this game doesn’t have much in terms of variety and when you combine that with the lack of exploration available to you things can start to get repetetive quite quickly. Despite this though Achtung! Cthulhu Tactics offers you a decent and enjoyable experience that features a few excitement moments along the way, and at the end of the day that’s enough to receive a thumbs up from me."

The Career Mode has been completely overhauled, and it feels great to work through full seasons in the Trucks, Xfinity, or Cup cars. The progression system is basic, but the mode does its best to emerge you in the world of motor-sports. Twitter feeds and pre-recorded video messages featuring many of the the drivers of the sport are fun, but could be improved with the next title. Online Multiplayer is also revamped, and the servers are quite stable. The Online racing is also greatly improved, and the ability to race in a full 40 car field of other live drivers is amazing. Where the games stalls is in performance. On console, the game can barely run at a solid 30 FPS, which is not great considering many new games are locked at 60. The physics are revamped from Evolution, but the graphics are not changed much here, and the lighting on the cars during specific time settings feels incredibly artificial. The cars look great, though, and the details on each of the hundreds of paint schemes are fantastic, and add to the immersion in Career. NASCAR Heat 2 is a great addition to a series that has a lot of potential for future installments, and provides a steady footing for 704 games to build upon."

On the surface that sounds awesome, and sometimes you find a tiny gem you want to save to play again or challenge your friends to. The mashing system is awkward and loaded with In-Jokes and Easter eggs. Every game gets a starting screen, and intro. this intro tells you your mission in the game, and is also where you'll find most of the humor, like referring to our princess from another castle, or the words etched in the clouds.  Each mash plays a little different, and takes its core elements from the first genre you chose and adds elements from the second game. Sometimes you get realty weird games like platforming with a jet fighter to collect enough money to buy a new spacshio in under 5 min. That's the whole game too, get the funds and you win. I've had some mashes take under 30 seconds to beat, others took over 30 minutes. This game is loaded with fun but also brings disappointment with the mash.

Sports|Individual|Biking|,"Apr 29, 2020",None,ASBO Interactive,59,ASBO Interactive,Shred! 2 - ft Sam Pilgrim,tbd,"Shred! 2 provides fun and challenge (sometimes to the point of rage and frustration) The thrill of pulling off insane tricks and physics impossible combinations immerses you in a surreal extreme sports world. The rag-doll physics from death and crashes always makes for good entertainment and there’s a wide variety in the courses and types of challenges to play. If you want to race, air it out big, or show off your riding skills there is a touch of something for every enthusiast present; even those who aren’t a biking enthusiast should find a nice blast of fun. The size of the studio and the content that they pushed out in this title are stunning to be honest, I’ve seen far less successful attempts at the genre from larger developers or studios and at higher costs of admission. That doesn’t mean Shred 2 is perfect in every way as it does suffer from control issues at times, but it’s quite a polished game given its minimalistic roots. Shred! 2 is a bit lacking in graphics but this isn't about graphics it all about fun - just don’t put your mind in the area of the Trials series from a presentation standpoint. Shred! 2 has applied laws above the laws of physics. The control is tolerable most of the time as in street style levels there are the occasional hit box detection properties that are off. Sometimes camera angles will come out of nowhere which can be just as aggravating as the snow levels *cough-cough*. On the subject of gameplay… the transfers, wall hops, and rotating while flip during tricks are some of the most over the top they could have envisioned for this extreme feeling you’d expect in the genre. If you can dream it, then it’s probably possible in Shred! 2 and is overall is a blast to play. The adrenaline gets pumping and it’s hard to put the controller down once you start even thru the frustration moments you will still want to succeed, which is one of Shred! 2’s strongest points in my opinion. It’s fast and easy to restart a level and that it’s a welcome addition to a game of this nature to horde off some of the frustration along the way and challenge it also brings when it’s truly your skills letting you down. Once again I want to draw attention to the quality of what is there from a small studio and at a great price of admission. Go pick this one up and you won’t regret it even during the mild rage episodes you may encounter at odd times here and there. It’s a solid addition the the Xbox indie library most should enjoy, and a must buy for fans of the genre for sure."

The original Layers of Fear I extremely enjoyed because it managed to scare me on multiple occasions. I was eager to play the sequel Layers of Fear 2, and as far as sequels go sometimes they fail to deliver a similar experience and sometimes they succeed. Layers of Fear 2 is greatly enhanced over the previous game, and an overall better game in all aspects. These enhancements were noticeable immediately as the immersion felt much more refined and the twisted nature of the game for me as a fan of the genre. Some players may find mild frustration from dying a few times, although I enjoy a challenge and thanks to the story I assure you that you will press on. There’s much more depth this time around, and when you factor in the puzzles that you come across you find yourself getting a strong sense of of immersion from Layers of Fear 2. If you’re looking for a game that enjoys to mess with your mind at every turn then you’ll thoroughly enjoy what Layers of Fear 2 has to offer. Recommending this game to you is very easy because as far as the horror genre goes this is a very good addition to the Xbox One family of consoles. Excellent work Gun Media, Bravo!"
Action|Shooter|Shoot-'Em-Up|Top-Down|,"Feb 28, 2018",E10+,Climax Studios,63,Climax Studios,RiftStar Raiders,tbd,"There is something about space games that really tickle my fancy and over the years I’ve sunk a huge amount of hours into games of this calibre, so I was really looking forward to this game. RiftStar Raiders may not be the best game I’ve played in this specific genre and it may have problems, but without a doubt it provided me with quite a few enjoyable moments. This game boasts a single player offering and co-op offering and in my opinion the best way to enjoy this game is in co-op. I found playing it this way to be incredibly fun and they encourage teamwork throughout, which is great. There are some fun moments to be had when playing alone but I found playing this way to incredibly difficult, so expect some frustrating moments when played alone. Something that really impressed me about this game was the level design. Each level is huge and there is plenty of exploring to be done which ultimately keeps things fresh and interesting for quite a while. In terms of gameplay the game provides you with frantic and very exciting action throughout and it does carry with it an addictive side to it. I will say though that the controls can be an absolute nightmare at times however. I never felt that I got the hang of the controls fully throughout my time with the game and the awkwardness of them can be a problem at times, especially when in the middle of a big battle. In terms of customisation the game has a huge amount for you to sink your teeth into, but the only problem is that it requires a lot of grinding for you to get the best equipment and this can make things become pretty tedious. The presentation side of the game surprised me quite a bit because I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Visually the game has a great look to it and it captures the space theme really well. The same can also be said about the sound design which does a great job of making the gameplay very immersive at times. At the end of the day fans of space combat will find more than enough to satisfy them here and I must admit that when all the elements combine together it provides you with a very fun and exciting experience. I wish I could score RiftStar Raiders higher but unfortunately it suffers with a few problems and whilst they aren’t major problems they still take away from your overall experience from time to time. That being said it has more good things than bad and in the end it does enough to get a thumbs up from me."

Role-Playing|Roguelike|,"Apr 25, 2018",T,E-Home Entertainment,63,E-Home Entertainment,Runestone Keeper,tbd,"Old-school RPG games played a massive part in my childhood and I found them to be my go to games when I was younger. Unfortunately there hasn’t been an abundance of old-school RPG’s in recent year’s and the one’s that have been released haven’t been the best to say the least. I was hoping that would change with the release of Runestone Keeper, but despite it being enjoyable at times it unfortunately suffered with quite a few problems. Don’t get me wrong they do get some things right and that’s definitely evident when it comes to the RPG mechanics that have been implemented. I must admit that I was surprised by the amount of depth that the RPG elements had and if they had a gentler difficulty curve then the elements would’ve been even better. Speaking about the difficulty curve it will no doubt cause you quite a few problems and when you combine it with the technichal issues the game suffers witth you end up getting frustrated a great deal. Some of the technichal issues the game has makes you not want to carry on and one particular issue that affects your progress is potentially game-breaking, which is unforgivable. It’s a shame because these aren’t the only problems the game suffers with because you will also have a few difficulties with the controls from time to time. These difficulties consist of unresponsive moments and at times the controls feel a little awkward and you can tell that the game was originally made for PC. Without a doubt these problems take away from the good things the game has to offer, and that’s a shame because in terms of the strategy aspects that are present they are actually very good and I definitely had fun planning my next moves. The fun factor however dwindles somewhat when you realise that the enemies you face don’t have a decent amount of variety and facing the same enemies time and time again does make things become quite tedious. One of my favourite things about the game is the presentation side of the game, and thankfully no problems occur here. They’ve done a very good job of capturing an old-school feel and when you combine the retro visuals and sound design together they do make things become more enjoyable from time to time. At the end of the day I so wanted Runestone Keeper to be a success on the Xbox One, but in the end the only feeling I got was that of disappointment. The game just has too many problems and there isn’t much in terms of content for you to get to grips with and this means that any enjoyment you get is incredibly short-lived. Fans of old school RPG’s will find a few aspects that will tickle their fancy, but unfortunately it just doesn’t get enough right to warrant a recommendation from me."

This game really feels like two different games smashed together into one amalgamation. There are 4 game modes, sort of. Atomic Drill is a tutorial mode, to get you acquainted with the mechanics of the game and decision making.  Apocalypse is the whole game, meshing the other two modes together. Scavenge is just the 60 seconds at the start of each playthrough. During this 60 seconds, you scramble to gather as many supplies, and family members, as you can and get them into the bunker as fast as possible. The Last mode, Survival, is the rest of a playthrough, where your family sits in the bunker, and you ration food and water, and react to different situations, or opt someone to go out and scavenge for more supplies. In the first 60 seconds, you amble around the house as the father, with clumsy controls, making this task even more complicated. The spawns of the items and your family are random, so there is no remembering where everything is, making each playthrough unfold differently. The Survival part is just stills of the family and bunker that change as the days pass. A lot of the game feels like it plays on chance, sometimes this feels unfair, but what's fair in a post-nuclear world? With nearly endless replay value due to its aextremely random nature !60 Seconds is a different but fun take on the survival genre."

Puzzle|Action|,"Feb  7, 2018",None,Marker Limited,63,Marker Limited,Samsara,tbd,"A lot of puzzle games that have made their way to consoles in recent years, and while they do lack action in terms of the gameplay I must admit that I do enjoy a good puzzle game. In order to make a successful puzzle game you obviously have to have decent puzzles and thankfully Samsara brings you some fantastic puzzles. There are over 70 puzzles for you to get to grips with in this game and some of them are really cleverly designed and have lots of variety. You really have to think about some of the puzzles and I liked that the game didn’t hold my hand when attempting to complete them because when you complete a difficult puzzle you get a great sense of satisfaction and reward. I will say though that some people may be put off by the difficulty of the puzzles and I would be lying if I said I didn’t get frustrated from time to time, but I definitely enjoyed it more than I got frustrated. The controls in the game hold up really well and they remain responsive throughout, so I never got frustrated at these which is great. Something that really impressed me about Samsara was the unique feeling of the mechanics that are in play during the game. Each mechanic feels original and this means things rarely get tedious and that means you want to continue time and time again. In terms of content there isn’t a great deal, which is a shame. Without a doubt I would have liked to have been able to have more content to play and that’s a testament to how good the game is because I enjoyed it so much. The presentation side of the game is simplistic in design and for me that works for the game really well. Visually the game is packed full of mesmerising colours and the accompanying sound design is simple yet effective and in my opinion it definitely gives the game a unique feel. At the end of the day as far as puzzle games go Samsara is a wonderful addition to the genre. This game is rare in the fact that it never seems to get repetetive and I must admit that I’ve hardly experienced that in a puzzle game before. Samsara won’t be for everyone and if you like action-packed games then this is something you won’t enjoy, but fans of any sort of puzzle games will absolutely adore this and me being a fan of this type of genre can’t recommend Samsara enough."

Not played Zombie Army though due to ditching PC gaming.  Was unsure whether to get this or not.  But the game is great.  There is nothing better than shooting Zombies I thought.  Well yes there is, shooting Nazi Zombies.   So far working my way through the game, each sort of chapter seems to take me about an hour.  Then I tend to put the game down, come back to it the next day.  Almost like episodic way of playing it, but it works.  Difficulty getting progressively harder,  New enemies introduced as you play through the campaign.   You need to look at boss fights in a tactical way, snipe from a distance or utilise explosives etc.   Being overrun, means you need to change your tactics.  Some interesting stuff to see and activate.  Collectibles not that easy to find, especially bottles.  Overall almost didn't buy it, but having a blast and I can't recommend it enough.

Miscellaneous|Compilation|,"Apr 18, 2019",T,Konami,62,Konami,Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection,tbd,"Konami's Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection isn't the most looked forward collection by Konami Arcade Collection coming to me personally, but it's what I would love to see more of from all the huge publishers that have amazing history and classics under their belt from the classic arcade ERA. When I received news that there were several Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection's by Konami on the way in the coming months I was excited to say mildly. This collection of games available  is overall solid, however their best collections are still coming. This collection is absolutely good but in comparison to the other classics packed in the series to follow I am basing my score on a whole of the collection, and not to say that any of the classics provided aren't the arcade bliss I remember so many years ago. The emulation of each game has been accomplished to near perfection. I found the presentation of the games to contain a lot of character as a package. It would be nice to see some DIP switch options for novice or newer players. There's a perfect balance of fun and challenge in each of the game’s in this collection. Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection may not have been my favorite from what the series is bringing, but in the end it's a solid collection well worth the price of admission. As a huge retro and classic gaming fan, I say great work Konami and can't wait for the next in the series."

Action|Miscellaneous|Fighting|Party / Minigame|3D|,"Dec  5, 2017",T,Square Enix,62,Square Enix,Oh My Godheads,tbd,"There’s nothing better than playing a fun and decent local multiplayer with friends and without a doubt there are quite a few classic game’s out there for you to sink your teeth into. Unfortunately though Oh My Godheads can’t be called a classic even though it offers you some enjoyable moments from time to time. The main reason this game can’t be called a classic is because it lacks depth and this means things can become boring quite quickly. Don’t get me wrong the game can be an incredible amount of fun for a short period, but to get the best out of the game you do have to play with friends. It does have single player but when you play on your own it gets boring almost instantly and the AI is very lacklustre and not very smart at all, which does makes things become frustrating. The gameplay on the whole has been done very well, and the best thing is that it remains responsive and fluid throughout. They have also thrown in a few unique ideas when it comes to the Godheads you can use, and I must admit that I appreciated the amount of variety the different characters had. In terms of modes the game doesn’t offer much so the replay value in the game is quite low. Some of the modes are also not good enough and I especially found this to be the case when I was tackling the boring trials mode. The presentation side of the game was something I was very fond of. Visually I loved the wacky art style and the sound design in a way makes you enjoy the game a little more, which is great. At the end of the day Oh My Godheads could have given you a lot more and if it did then the game would have got a much higher score from me. Fans of local multiplayers will find some enjoyment here and it does get some of the basics right, but unfortunately any fun is short-lived because there just isn’t enough depth to the game. I can’t unfortunately fully recommend Oh My Godheads to you because there are better game’s in the genre for a cheaper price, so I would wait until the price drops before you give this game a go."

Role-Playing|Action RPG|,"Jan  7, 2019",T,Devolver Digital,62,Sloclap,Absolver,7.3,"The presentation side of the game provides a mix of enjoyment for me and the visuals and sound design brought the game experience alive in a number of ways. I really enjoyed the combat elements that were present in the game and I must admit that I didn’t expect the combat to have as much depth as it had. It mixes together a number of different genre’s and for the most part these different genre’s combine together extremely well. There’s a decent variety of cards you can use when swapping and changing your deck and this keeps things fresh and interesting for longer than one might expect. The game suffers with a few technical issues every now as do most games at times along the way. Not much offered in the way of a tutorial and the lack of depth here does cause a few learning curves along the way. The difficulty curve to be a problem at times because out of nowhere it can become unforgiving which could cause frustration for those looking for a more laid back experience. I’ve been waiting for Absolver to make its way to the Xbox One. That’s mainly because I love game’s that mesh different genre’s mashed together. Thankfully the different genre’s mesh together really well and this does create an enjoyable experience within the game, however the game is far from perfect. Unfortunately the game does suffer with a few technical issues every now and then and while none of these are major they can have an overall impact at times. The difficulty curve in the game can also be a problem as well but I advise that you look past this because when in full flow you realise quite quickly that the combat elements in the game have a lot of depth within them. Another aspect where the gameplay has depth is in regards to the deck building mechanics and without a doubt trying each card is fun and definitely makes things stay fresh and interesting for longer. I just wish certain aspects were explained a little more though because it can be confusing at times. At the end of the day then whilst Absolver definitely gets more right than it gets wrong and the uniqueness that’s present in certain areas does keep you coming back for more time and time again which means it does more than enough to get a recommendation from me. Thumbs up!"
Action Adventure|General|Survival|,"Feb 20, 2018",M,Konami,62,Konami,Metal Gear Survive,2.0,"The idea of a survival zombie game in a delapitated alternate world mixed with Metal Gear Solid artstyle and gameplay was not appealing to me from the reveal trailer but after I saw a video of gameplay I was intrigued. Now after a few hours I am really enjoying this game. The gameplay and progression has a welcoming pace. I bought it thinking it’s a “game-as-service” type game where you log in and do a match or two online but was surprised by the campaign content. It’s nothing extravagant and is like a B horror film in some ways which is good because it knows it’s a spin off and doesn’t damage the Metal Gear brand. I like how you can mold this character that comes to life in the cinematics and story. Your ‘avatar’ grows as you play, learning skills and being able to play different classes. In campaign, the survival part is realistic where you have to hunt for food and gather water, otherwise you can start losing health and stamina and eventually die. It has a Breath or the Wild feel in those mechanics. You gather parts all over and build up your base as you see fit to defend yourself from different types of infected mutants. There are daily, weekly and monthly challenges that net you different resources for unlocking content so you can log in daily for a short time and still progress.  I’m playing on the Xbox One X and the HDR and enhancements look great on the screen, I hope MGS5 Phantom Pain gets similar enhancements in a patch. If you see it for what it is, I think you will enjoy what the developers have created here. This is not meant to be an important entry in the Metal Gear series, but instead a way to have fun with the world and mechanics in a different way and in that it succeeds. It’s also priced fairly for what it is. The only gripe I have so far is if you want to create a new avatar, you have to either delete your first one, log in as a different account, or buy a character slot for coins which I think (not sure) are only available via real money. I will update the review after I spend more time with it and get to play the online."

You start with a two-part bus, and you travel around the stage picking up passengers. By picking up passengers I mean they're magnetically yanked from the bus stops screaming as they're pulled into your bus. There are dropoff points along the stages, and when you pass through one of them you drop the passengers off for score, well eject them violently.  There are 11 stages and six busses, all but the starting Transit bus, and the Hotwheels track filled Dorm you start with are unlocked with your score. You accumulate score as an overall as you play through the stages and you unlock the different levels and busses. As you pick up your passengers and drop them off, you get more segments to your bus. The longer you get the harder it becomes to navigate. You also have thrusters on your front bus, allowing you to ""Jump"" over obstacles including your own bus sections. The game has a global leaderboard, as well as your own personal accomplishments. The game is strangely addictive, and yields hours of amusement.

Puzzle|Action|,"Feb  6, 2019",E,It's Anecdotal,66,It's Anecdotal,39 Days to Mars,tbd,"I really enjoyed the presentation side of the game because both the visuals and sound design feel unique and this does make the game stand out quite a bit. You can tell that a lot of thought has been placed into the puzzles that are present in the game and this thought means completing the puzzles felt rewarding. Without a doubt this game is best played in co-op and when played this way you and your friend definitely get quite a few fun and enjoyable moments. While the story doesn’t have a huge amount of depth to it I actually found what was here to be enjoyable and the humor is truly entertaining. I found when playing the game on my own that I did become pretty frustrated with the difficulty so the gameplay wasn’t as fun because of this. While there is a local co-op offering there isn’t any online modes which disappointed me a little, since couch co-op isn't overly common these days. In terms of content the game doesn’t have a huge amount for you and it can be completed in a couple of hours. 39 Days to Mars is one of them rare games that lets you complete the whole game with a friend and this does make the game stand out quite considerably when it comes to the puzzle genre. Another aspect of the game that makes it stand out is its presentation because for me both the visuals and sound design are unique to the core and deliver fun and enjoyment in several areas. As I said earlier this game is meant to be played in local co-op but you can also play it on your own. I will say though that if you play it on your own it’s nowhere near as fun and it’s a lot more frustrating due to the difficulty. Thankfully though the puzzles didn’t frustrate me much at all and I must admit that I was impressed with how creative and clever some of them were and without a doubt completing each puzzle felt rewarding because of this. This is a good thing as well because there isn’t much in terms of content so it was very important to make the content that is avaliable to you interesting, which thankfully they do. At the end of the day then whilst 39 Days to Mars doesn’t get everything right it does manage to get the most important aspects right and if you’re a fan of local co-op puzzle games then you can do much worse than this game. It's just a bit on the short side."

Racing|Arcade|Futuristic|,"Sep 26, 2017",E,Lost in the Garden,65,Lost in the Garden,Lightfield,tbd,"Lightfield is one of them classic games that has a very good core concept, but unfortunately it has nothing else. I appreciate the effort they have put in to make their game feel unique, but you come away from the game feeling bored and at times you don’t really want to return. It’s not all doom and gloom though because the physics and omnidirectional mechanic have been done really well, and it can be fun attaching yourself to various surfaces at the start. Unfortunately though the gameplay does get repetitive quickly, and the lack of content really doesn’t help this. Every game mode in the game feels the same and the lack of variety makes the replay value very low. The tracks in the game are actually very cleverly designed and I like how you can find shortcuts here and there, but unfortunately there are only seven tracks for you to enjoy. The movement in the game can be quite awkward at times and it didn’t feel that the controls always remained responsive, which isn’t great in a game like this. The game can also be quite difficult at times and you never feel like you’re going to catch up because there always seems to be a linear route despite it being open-world. My favourite thing about the game was definitely the presentation. Visually the space and futuristic look can look awesome at times, and it really does do a great job of making the gameplay stand out. I was also a fan of the soundtrack and I think the relaxing music fits the style very well. At the end of the day Lightfield could have been a lot better in my opinion, and it definitely never reaches its full potential. They do have some interesting ideas in play here, but unfortunately the lack of content and the niggling problems it has will be really the only thing you remember. The price of the game is quite steep and I can only recommend the game when it lowers quite a bit in price."

From the moment I began Degrees of Separation I was captured by the superb art style and the adventure at hand. Both the visuals and sound design definitely had a lot of time devoted to them. At the core this game is a puzzle game with platform elements combined and thankfully, the puzzles have been done well overall. The puzzles have been done well enough that I was prepared to look past the lack of difficulty and focused solely on the creativity within each of the puzzles. The environments had a ton of creativity and this meant exploration rarely got dull, all thought it was a nit cumbersome when I had to backtrack a few times during my play through. Degrees of Separation gets another nod, because everything runs smoothly and each mechanic is worthwhile and doesn’t hold the game back. I do have a couple of complaints though, as it isn’t a perfect experience but I could look past the lack of depth in the story and the backtracking because everything else is done well. In summary, this then means that recommending Degrees of Separation isn't difficult because it offers you a fun and enjoyable experience, I will say my time with the game was enjoyed playing with someone else, and I’m sure fans of this particular game will enjoy the single player and multiplayer aspects it offers."

The controls remain fluid at all times and most important of all there simple and responsive, which means you can focus on the fun gameplay without worrying that the controls will let you down. Speaking about the gameplay to say I had fun would be a massive understatement, and the best thing is that no game ever plays out the same way so there is some replaybility present. You will however have to get used to the difficulty curve in the game because at the start it can be a little too difficult so expect to get frustrated every now and then. As you progress though you will notice that you get better and better and that’s mainly down to the very good unlockables you get along the way. Without a doubt each unlockable improves you considerably and it was very fun trying out each weapon because each weapon has a lot of variety going for it. The game also boasts a lot of variety when it comes to the enemies you face and destroying them feels very satisfying, which is a bonus. I will say though that the game is best enjoyed in short bursts because even though it does have variety in a few areas the gameplay is basically the same throughout. This isn’t a problem when playing with a friend but when you play on your own after a short while things can become a little tedious. You will also notice a few technichal issues during your time with the game as well, but thankfully the developers are releasing a patch and none of the issues are anything major so you can easily look past them. The presentation side of the game may not be to everybody’s liking, but I really enjoyed it and I think the visuals and sound design combined together really well and in a way they gave the game a little bit of uniqueness. At the end of the day I Hate Running Backwards may not be the best Shoot-‘Em-Up out there but it does what it sets out to do extremely well and that is provide you with fun and frantic action. Without a doubt this is a game I can see myself returning to time and time again and it does more than enough to get a recommendation from me."

Hot Garbage is however only a small addon, while it is a nice addition to the game the overall experience is short.  Also it doesn't seem to capture the same feel as the base game did upon release but it does bring a new feel to the game and that's not a bad thing. Graphically Hot Garbage stays true with great looking enviroment and character design and exploring is still fun and not a chore. Overall: If you happen to Journey to the Savage Planet then adding this to your game is a must do.

Rad Rodgers is a platformer that does this and whilst it has a few shortcomings I ended up having a hell of a time with the game for the most part. There are a few different mechanics in play at the same time in this game and they’ve done a very good job here. Platforming feels very smooth and the shooting elements provide you with quite a few enjoyable moments. I would however have liked the weapon upgrades to feel like they mattered more, but unfortunately I never felt any more powerful when I collected these. The controls which are obviously the most important thing in a game like this thankfully remained tight and responsive throughout and I never suffered with any problems here, which is great. The level design in the game is something that tickled my fancy quite a bit and whilst the levels can be a little on the long side I found exploring them to be extremely fun and there are plenty of secrets littered throughout, which in turn keeps things fresh. There are a few enemies you have to battle in the game and some of them are not too bad, but I just thought the enemies were missing something. They just feel a little generic and nothing much stands out with them, which is a shame. Something that does stand out in the game is the humour that’s present. This game had me chuckling to myself a number of times, but I must admit that they can go a bit too far at times. The presentation side of the game is without a doubt one of my favourite parts about the game. Visually the game is very crisp looking and packed full of colour and the most impressive part is that it looks retro and modern at the same time. The sound design has also been very well done and it does a great job of enhancing the gameplay at times. At the end of the day Rad Rodgers is a game that’s right up my alley and if you’re a fan of platformers that have a naughty side to them then you will really enjoy this game. Don’t get me wrong there are better games in the genre but Rad Rodgers has charm in abundance and for that reason it gets a thumbs up from me."

The game controls can get confusing for non flyer type gamers. i feel that the graphics are a 8/10 because of the face that it looks similar to a flight  simulator when you are in first person mode but overall i would love to give the game a 8/10 beacuse of the face that the game features planes that are no longer used in modern day times and the feel of flying and using an old fighter jet and or bomber is really nice! the story concept of the game is 10/10 script wise and you feel like you are the pilot with how some of the dialog goes in the stoy campaign mode! Now for the multiplayer aspect of the game could use a but work was kind of difficult to find out how to ing people to play it with and some of the options to host a multiplayer lobby was kinda good, but as I said before trying to invite other players was a but difficult to do. So my overal oppinion of your game is 9/10. Why such high rating well I am a fan of flyers and well your game was very indept on how it was presented to the masses, its fun even children under 15 I would recomend it for them to play because of the game play, storytelling, and not much inappropriate things displayed by that i mean none at all it's a good and wonderful game that should be rated E for everyone.

Most of your brother monks dead, including your mentor, you now seek vengeance on the affiliation you once served. With parts of his past remembered through the cut-scenes, you learn why Vasily came to be where he is. The game play is fast paced and brutal, with ample weapons, and environmental hazards to use in dispatching your enemies, the action is nearly nonstop. The stages are fairly linear with little in the way of exploration, with the exception of a few hidden scrolls and tablets to find. As you progress and find these tablets and scrolls you gain access to attacks, and abilities, broken between your Soldier training, and your Monk training.  The game play gets repetitive at times, but that's to be expected from a Beat-Em-Up game. Skull bashing combos and devastating finishers are the bread and butter of this game, once the combat system is learned you can near effortlessly string attacks from one enemy to another, countering the whole way.

I really enjoyed the presentation side of the game because both the visuals and sound design have a retro vibe and both of them also create even more humor. It may not be the most innovative platformer ever but everything works well and the easy to pick up and play style makes the gameplay more fun. There isn’t a huge amount of content available to you I think they’ve got the right amount and it doesn’t overstay its welcome. There isn’t much variety present in both the environments and the enemies you have to face in the game. The game doesn’t deliver to you much of a challenge and I think a bit more of a challenge would’ve made more people interested in the game. Once completed your highly unlikely to return back to the game because there isn’t really anything  that pulls you back, which is a shame. Does Sigi – A Fart for Melusina do enough to get a recommendation from me? The juvenile side of me came right to the forefront when I saw the word “Fart” and I knew that Sigi – A Fart for Melusina was a game I had to try out, and in the end I’m pretty pleased I did try it out. Don’t get me wrong this game is far from being a classic but what it does do is offer you a hilarious adventure without ever taking itself too seriously. I’ll admit to you now that the silly story had me chuckling away on a number of occasions and this did make me enjoy the game quite considerably. Another aspect of the game I enjoyed was the platforming elements because everything has been done well here and it never becomes too taxing. I would however have liked a little bit more of a challenge and more in terms of variety when it came to the enemies but the price of the game is relatively cheap and the content you get is good so in the end I have to give the game a solid thumbs up."

It took me a bit to learn the controls and settings to be able to play somewhat decently. The game has you move your stick left to yaw/roll right, and move the stick right to yaw/roll left. Also set the sticks to have 0 acceleration in its default center state otherwise its impossible to hold down on acceleration to assist with turns and dive style turns down, or for the quickly needed handbrake turns. By default there's tons of upward acceleration and hardly any speed going down if you hold down to accelerate. I get why they would have that option, it just felt awkward to me set up that way. I was able to complete the easy maps. I've mastered them for the most part for the different drones to select from. I tried to play the intermediate maps and failed miserably, so maybe it’s just my lack of experience and drone flying skills in the way, but it seems this game will be difficult to master for newcomers like myself. If you’re a fan of drones or experienced in the flying of them you may have a much easier go than I have experienced, I've seen the pros on TV and my skills in no way match those.

Sports|Individual|Other|,"Oct 16, 2018",E,Outright Games,66,Climax Studios,Crayola Scoot,tbd,"The presentation side of the game ticked a lot of boxes for me and whilst I enjoyed the sound design I was especially impressed with the colourful visuals present. I liked the easy to pick up and play style that has been implemented because this does make itself accessible to gamers of all ages. In terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to be getting on with and the variety present in the content means the game does have some replaybility. The skating elements in the game have been done really well and performing combos always feels satisfying and never gets boring. I enjoyed the single-player offerings at times it does get a little too difficult which can be frustrating. A more advanced tutorial would’ve been nice because whilst it features an easy to pick up and play style it does take a little bit of getting used to. Some modes fail to hit the mark which in turn means they aren’t as fun as the other modes in the game. As a fan of skating game’s I can’t help but feel starved because there hasn’t been many skating game’s at all in recent years. I will admit now though that despite being starved of skating game’s I didn’t have high expectations when it came to Crayola Scoot, but after sinking a number of hours in I will admit now that I was wrong because it’s a good game that offers a lot of fun and enjoyable moments. Obviously the crux of this game is its skating elements and I’m pleased to say that they’ve got this aspect spot on and skating and performing combos always felt satisfying and most important of all fun. The gameplay also doesn’t take long to get used to as well due to its easy to pick up and play style, but despite this I still would’ve liked a more advanced tutorial because it takes a bit of getting used to at the start. At the end of the day though whilst the game has a few shortcomings none of them are too severe and without a doubt Crayola Scoot gets more things right than it gets wrong. This then means recommending the game is quite easy because it offers you a generous amount of content that’s varied and fun for gamers of all ages."

Role-Playing|Japanese-Style|,"Jun 18, 2019",T,Sega,66,Sega,Citizens of Space,tbd,"Citizens Of Space is a well-crafted follow-up to the original that manages to keep its sense of humor intact. The visual and audio presentation are bright sharp and crisp and very easy on the eyes. Meanwhile the gameplay has been revamped in Citizens Of Space. The retro style Earthbound system has been swapped out for a more Paper Mario esque combat timing strategy system which is either a positive or a negative, depending on whether your preferred the old battle system or the new battle system they have implemented this time around. If you enjoy a game with a more active time/strategy based game, you will love what Citizens Of Space has to offer. If you like being able to automate combat more with this being more of the norm in the gaming world these days, then you may not enjoy the battle system as much as the previous one. Either way, the core game is a lot of fun even with a few rough edges and I am happy Sega brought us Citizens Of Space. While it’s not ultimately the perfect experience with either combat system they would have chosen, it still manages to get most things right. At the end of the day Citizens Of Space provides a fun and entertaining experience for Xbox One fans to enjoy. The price of admission is also fair and you get a good value for the fun that awaits."

You've been created to help an Earth Elemental fix the relations with his siblings. The story was interesting, but the jarring, still frame cutscenes detracted from what was going on. Given the smooth and beautiful graphics of the game and the clean art of the still frames, I felt jipped every second of every cutscene. The gameplay is back and forth between fast-paced rolling and platforming in your skull form, then solving puzzles with one of your Golem forms. The platforming is bland, and I never felt like my abilities were being tested, in some segments even used. I felt like so much more could have been done with how fast you roll, and the incredible inertia, and gravity physics that are woven into the game. The Golems are limited in what they're capable of, each with their own couple of abilities. The puzzles relied too heavily on mixing these abilities. Scattered around the world are leaves, they seem to line out the paths, but don't have any real bearing on gameplay. They unlock character art, and thats all. So much more could have been done here, it felt lacking, even in the final stretches, when things started to get challenging. Skully is an interesting journey to take if you can get past the cutscenes, and lackluster platforming."

Action Adventure|General|,"Jan 19, 2018",E,FinalBoss Games,66,FinalBoss Games,Vesta,tbd,"Puzzle platformers have been going for a long time now and I must confess that I actually quite enjoy them because I don’t find them to taxing, which is nice. Vesta is the latest game to enter the puzzle adventure genre and for the most part it holds up pretty well and it can deliver some enjoyable moments despite the niggling problems it has. Something that really impressed me about this game was the level design. The levels in the game are full of variety and that means things don’t become boring, which is great. The gameplay has a lot of different mechanics in play at the same time and they all hold up really well, and I must admit that I was especially impressed with the character-swapping mechanic. The game also boasts quite a few different puzzles and whilst none of them are bad in design I found them to be a little on the easy side and I was craving more of a challenge. An important aspect in a game like this is how the controls hold up, and thankfully they hold up really well. They keep things simple when it comes to the controls and this means you can focus on the tasks at hand and the best thing is that these tasks never cause you problems because everything remains responsive throughout. Unfortunately everything isn’t all plain sailing in the game though and it does suffer with a few technical issues. The main issue I came across was the saving feature because sometimes it doesn’t always save and if you die you can lose a lot of progress, which is very frustrating to say the least. The presentation side of the game is nothing special but it is something that I enjoyed. Visually the game has a nice look to it and it has quite a bit of charm going for it. The sound design is also charming and it never once got on my nerves, which is a bonus. At the end of the day Vesta is a game that provided me with quite a bit of fun and in a way I wanted a little more. Unfortunately there isn’t much content for you to sink your teeth into and with no multiplayer modes the replay value is quite low, which is a shame. I will say though that the content it does have is pretty good and it does enough to get a recommendation from me."

Action|General|,"Dec 26, 2018",None,Dark-1,69,Dark-1,Odium To the Core,tbd,"The presentation side of the game stands out brilliantly in a number of areas which made both the visuals and sound design very enjoyable. In terms of the content the game has a decent amount for you to get your hands on and the best thing is that the content has plenty of replay ability as well. There’s an easy to pick up and play style that’s featured in the gameplay which is very important because it makes you want to carry on even when you die a lot. When you complete the varied levels you get a great sense of achievement which in turn makes you enjoy the gameplay even more. Technically the game held up really well throughout and the controls remain tight and responsive as well which does keep the frustration levels down a little. The difficulty curve can be very unforgiving at times so expect to die a huge amount of times along the way. I expected a little bit more from the bosses in the game because they fail to stand out in a few areas. Odium to the Core creates a very retro experience and if you like game’s that feature a challenging yet fun experience then you’ll thoroughly enjoy what this game has to offer. At its core this game is a side-scroller based on speed and accuracy and I’m pleased to say that they’ve nailed several important aspects along the way. One of the most important aspects they’ve got right are the controls which feel tight and responsive at all times. This is very important because the gameplay is quite unforgiving and this does bring some frustration, so the fluid controls do help to manage this frustration. Despite this frustration though it still didn’t stop me from returning back to the game time and time again and this isn’t a problem either because the game has a decent amount of content and replaybility. The content also features an easy to pick up and play style which combines with the different varied levels extremely well. Each level also features a brilliant presentation as well and I must admit that both the visuals and sound design did make each level stand out quite a lot. At the end of the day then if you like game’s that challenge you to the max then Odium to the Core is a must buy and when it’s all said and done this game gets a lot right culminating in a thumbs up from me."

Fission Superstar X gained my attention almost immediately because it had a look to it that was very unique, but was the gameplay as unique as its presentation? Yes it is, because it features a number of different mechanics you wouldn’t expect in this genre and the most impressive thing is that these different mechanics work extremely well together. Fission Superstar X is a side-scrolling shooter and a challenging side-scrolling shooter,  so expect a challenge each time you begin a new run. The challenge then can become overbearing early on while you gain familiarity in the game, so you may encounter a slight frustration on occasion. Fission Superstar X does assist by offering a huge amount of effective weapons to defeat the amount of challenging enemies and for the most part each weapon feels like it matters and is not there just for show. The content of the game has enough to keep you coming back hungry for each new run. Fission Superstar X may be very difficult and not have much of a story, but what it does well is provide an experience that’s fun and worthwhile at the same time. If you enjoy side-scrolling shooters like I do, then this game deserves a place in your Xbox One gaming library, because it’s unique in a number of different ways and gets many things very right, and some slightly wrong."

Gonner 2 is a prime example of how to do a sequel. It polishes, adjusts, and adds to the previous game. The thing is Gonner is still considered one of the best Splatformers around so getting a sequel that’s actually good is quite the rarity. Now for me, it did take a while to get used to the game again as it been a long time since I played the original, I had a lot of moments where I didn’t know what was going on or why such and such thing happened but the thing was I couldn’t stop playing it.

I found the gameplay to be extremely fun because racing at high speeds and doing multiple flips always felt rewarding and exhilarating. There’s a decent selection of tracks for you to race on and the variety that’s present in them means things stay fresh and interesting for longer. The inclusion of a four-player split screen is fantastic because it’s very rare nowadays and it does make the game more fun and also give it replayability. I was slightly disappointed with the campaign mode in the game because it’s very basic and nothing much stands out. In terms of content the game doesn’t have a huge amount for you to get to grips with and in my opinion this makes the price of the game too high. Racing is fun for the most part I found the handling to be not as smooth and fluid as I would’ve liked it to be. Back in the day I can remember playing a fantastic little game called Rollcage and it was fantastic because it was unlike any other game I’d played before. Unfortunately there hasn’t really been many game’s since then that have captured that same formula, well that is until now. GRIP: Combat Racing may have a few shortcomings but it offers you an experience that’s very unique compared to most racing game’s out there. It also offers you a fun and at times very exhilarating experience as well and performing various flips always feels rewarding. You can also perform these flips in four-player split screen as well and whilst the handling was a little bit stiff at times it still remained fun when playing this way. Most of the problems the game has are small but for me the game has a big underlying issue and that is that it just doesn’t have enough content to warrant its high asking price. Despite this though GRIP: Combat Racing still does enough to get a solid recommendation from me because even though it’s in a crowded genre it stands out because it is unique in a number of areas and when in full flow your guaranteed to have a lot of fun with the game."

Exploration plays a big part in this specific genre and thankfully this game allows you to explore in great detail and the best thing is that this game is at its most rewarding when doing this. The game has a number of different mechanics in play at the same time and they’ve all been done really well. This makes the game very fulfilling and this will no doubt appeal to a number of different gamer’s. The gameplay on the whole has been done really well and I was especially fond of the boss battles. The boss battles carry with them a distinct challenge and when you combine that with the clever design of them you end up becoming immersed with them quite a lot. I will say though that the challenging aspect of the game won’t be for everybody and I must admit that I myself did find it a tad too difficult at times. Something that really surprised me about this game was how enjoyable the story was. The story in the game is told in a clever way and this keeps things interesting and it also makes you want to discover more things about the story. In terms of length the game doesn’t offer you a great deal and that will disappoint some because if you’re anything like me then you will want a lot more, which in a way is a testament to how good the game is. The presentation side of the game is something that I really enjoyed. The visuals are spot on and I think the 8-bit art style fits the game’s theme very well. The same can also be said about the sound design used in the game and they really have done a wonderful job of capturing certain feelings. At the end of the day I’ve heard a lot of good things about The Aquatic Adventure of The Last Human and now I can see why. They’ve done everything pretty much to perfection and delivered on the areas you would expect in this specific genre. It is a little on the short side but your time with the game will be very rewarding and without a doubt this definitely makes the game a must buy."

Thankfully its made its way to console and I now understand why my friends loved it so much. The gameplay that’s present in the game works ever so well with a number of different mechanics in play at the same time. It may be a little bit too difficult for some but I found the challenge to be just right and it kept me coming back for more time and time again. The controls which are obviously very important in a game like this feel great and most important of all they remain responsive at all times, which in turn allows you to focus on the puzzles at hand. The puzzles range in variety and do a great job of breaking up the normal gameplay and I must admit that I enjoyed the thought process that has gone into some of them. In terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to sink your teeth into. Each level feels completely different from the other and I appreciated how cleverly designed they were because by doing this it keeps the game both fresh and interesting throughout. There wasn’t many gripes that I had with the game really and the only thing that really disappointed me was its lack of a story. There is a story present in the game but it’s not blessed with much to get to grips with and I think more of a story would have benefited the game’s style greatly, which is charming to say the least. The presentation side of the game is one of my favourite parts about Switch: Or Die Trying because you can tell a lot of effort has gone in here. Visually the game looks beautiful and has a lot of little details included and when you accompany this with the charming music that’s present you find that they both enhance the gameplay quite considerably. At the end of the day as far as puzzle platformers go this is without a doubt up there with some of the best I’ve ever played. They get every little element in the game spot on and whilst it can be difficult at times it still didn’t stop me from wanting to carry on. If you’re a fan of this specific genre then Switch: Or Die Trying is an absolute must buy and I would even recommend it to newcomers of the genre as well. Xbox Store link : https://goo.gl/mrn5zw"

I found the combat elements in the game to be pretty decent and the fast action-packed pace means each battle is exciting and rewarding. While it can get repetitive quite quickly the perks and different weapons you can use do a good job of combating this because using each of these is fun. Each stage has a decent amount of variety present within them and I really enjoyed that there are no places to hide when in combat on these stages. The gameplay is very fun for the most part, butt it does lack in terms of depth which in turn makes it get repetitive quite quickly. I enjoyed the uniqueness of each of the character’s but in my opinion there isn’t enough of them. In terms of content the game doesn’t have a huge amount even with the added addition of local and online co-op. Fast-paced games are often very fun and exciting for the most part because they never give you much time to think and without a doubt Hyper Jam is cut from this cloth. The crux of this game then is to destroy your enemy no matter what and destroying your enemy always carries a very rewarding feeling with it. One of the main reasons why it feels very rewarding is because the combat elements are fast and fluid and using each different perk and weapon gives the gameplay an extra edge to it. The gameplay then is pretty fun and enjoyable when in full flow but I would still recommend that you play the game in short bursts though because there isn’t a great deal of depth to the gameplay which means it does get repetetive quite quickly. There also isn’t a huge amount of content for you to get to grips with as well and in my opinion this is a shame because the character’s it does have are unique and very enjoyable to try out. Thankfully these are the only real issues with this game because the presentation side of the game ticks all of the right boxes and there’s a decent amount of variety present in the different stages. Recommending Hyper Jam then is pretty easy because if played for short bursts you get a thrilling and action-packed experience that’s definitely worth your time and your friends and in my opinion you can do much worse than this game."

Gravel has come out to change that and thankfully it’s a very good addition to the genre, and despite it suffering with a few shortcomings it ultimately provides you with some brilliant racing. Racing in the game has a true arcade feel, so don’t expect too much realism because they haven’t gone for that approach. The racing on the whole though is very fun and the best thing is that it feels great whilst also offering you a challenge. In terms of vehicles there is a huge amount for you to get to grips with and each vehicle feels considerably different, which is great. There is a decent array of circuits for you to race on and each circuit is packed full of variety which without a doubt keeps things fresh for a lot longer. Gravel offers you a pretty decent career mode and it can be very enjoyable at times, unfortunately though there just isn’t enough of it and that’s basically the biggest problem with this game. There isn’t enough in terms of content as well and if more modes were added I could see myself playing this game for a very long time because everything else has been done extremely well. They do offer you some online multiplayer offerings and this does give the game some much needed replay value. As far as the online multiplayer goes everything holds up really well and I didn’t suffer with any noticeable problems, which is great. Hopefully they keep adding content and make the online multiplayer bigger because that will without a doubt keep the game relevant for a lot longer. The presentation side of the game is something that tickled my fancy quite a lot. Visually the game can look beautiful at times and the effects when going into water have been done very well. The sound design is also pretty decent and it does more than enough to keep you satisfied. At the end of the day Gravel is a game that I’ve been looking forward to for quite a while and thankfully it exceeded my expectations in a way. It may not be perfect and it may be lacking on the content side, but what’s here works well and most important of all it provides you with a true and fun arcade style. Fans of arcade racers will definitely find something they love in Gravel and with me being a fan of arcade racers I appreciate the effort that’s gone into the game and I hope Gravel gets bigger and bigger."

Action Adventure|Adventure|General|Open-World|,"Sep 21, 2018",M,Nnooo,70,Epiphany Games,Anodyne,tbd,The presentation side of the game ticked a lot of boxes for me and I think that’s mainly because both the visuals and sound design enhanced the gameplay. Exploring in the game always feels rewarding because there always seems to be that there is something new for you to find. There is a decent variety of enemies you come across during your time with the game and I must admit that I was especially impressed with the bosses. Each mechanic the game possesses has been implemented really well and they all add something to the overall gameplay. There’s an array of different puzzles you have to wade through and I must admit that I was surprised by how creative the puzzles were. The combat is fun in short bursts it does get repetetive quite quickly and that’s mainly due to the lack of depth the combat has. The game is a little on the short side and it did leave me wanting more. It can get quite difficult out of nowhere at times which cab cause you to be a little frustrated every now and then. Anodyne definitely has a Zelda-esque vibe going for it but that doesn’t mean that it’s like Zelda. Instead this game has its own identity as well and when it’s all said and done it delivers a very rewarding and fun adventure to you. One of the main reasons why the game is so fun and enjoyable is due to the number of mechanics the game possesses because each mechanic adds something to the gameplay. This then means that exploring is always worthwhile and if the combat had more depth to it then you would nearly have a perfect experience with this game. Thankfully though the shortcomings it does have aren’t too profound and the variety it has made me forget about the little niggling problems. I do wish however that the game was a little longer because the different enemies and different puzzles within the game left me wanting more. That being said the content it does have makes recommending Anodyne very easy and I’m sure fans of these types of game’s will love what Anodyne has to offer.

Racing|Arcade|Futuristic|,"May  2, 2020",E,Iceberg Interactive,70,Iceberg Interactive,Antigraviator,6.3,"Antigraviator is an Anti-Gravity High-Speed Racer. Prepare to learn tracks. That is the only mastery to this game, as the speeds are ridiculous! It's hard to see what's coming around the next turn in time to actually react. This is how I imagined Pod Racing from Star Wars, and sort of how it's explained in the movie, so fast humans usually don't have the reflexes to compete. You have a small handful of vehicles and a slim variety of modifications. The game is intense off the break, an exhilarating journey into speed. There is no top end to the speeds you can achieve if you can stay off the guard rails long enough to achieve those crazy speeds. I was a fan of the F-Zero franchise and thought I had what it takes to race in this environment, but I was wrong. You will have to learn each track and its insane curves, there are very few straightaways, lending to the rail hugging. The game does away with the traditional power-ups for Cells, these can be used to boost at any time and to activate traps. The trap system was very disappointing, as you're blasting along so fast you tend to miss the spot you can activate the traps from, again unless you've memorized each of the tracks, and there are plenty of tracks. I Feel like Antigraviator could use a bit of polishing, and maybe some less stressful tracks at the start of the game. Even with these negative overtones, I had a blast hugging the rails between utilizing the break-neck speeds this game offers."
Adventure|Point-and-Click|,"Mar 13, 2018",T,THQ Nordic,70,THQ Nordic,The Raven Remastered,6.8,"The Raven originally came out in 2013 and unfortunately I never tried it out which is a shame because I heard quite a lot of good things about it. As you can imagine I was pretty pleased to learn that it was making its way to Xbox One in the form of a remaster, and thankfully I’m glad I tried it out this time because it’s a very good point-and-click adventure. Without a doubt the best thing about this game is its story and to say it had me hooked throughout would be a massive understatement. Each chapter has had a lot of thought and effort put into it and the writing shines through at all times, which of course makes the character’s stand out quite considerably. Each character in the game is interesting and they each have their own little quirks which ultimately makes you become even more attached to the story. In terms of gameplay The Raven Remastered doesn’t have a great deal to sink your teeth into, but the gameplay that is present is thankfully decent enough. Some of the puzzles in the game have been done really well but I must admit that some of the puzzles also didn’t fit in with what was going on storywise which did hurt the immersion levels a little bit at times. I will say though that every puzzle I completed felt very rewarding because some can go on for quite a while and they do require a little thought every now and then. In terms of content the game has a generous amount for you to be getting on with and I very rarely got bored thanks to the fantastic story. I did however have a few frustrating moments and that was mainly down to the awkward movement of the characters and the controls that went with it, but thankfully this was only a small problem and I was able to look past it quite quickly. The presentation side of the game had a couple of technichal issues but it still didn’t stop me from enjoying what was on offer here. Visually the game looks pretty good most of the time and when you combine that with the excellent sound design and voice acting it does more than enough to satisfy you. At the end of the day if like me you never played the original of this game then I thoroughly recommend you try out The Raven Remastered. It’s one of the most enjoyable point-and-click adventures I’ve played and it will have you hooked by its fantastic story from start to finish. I love when games surprise me and without a doubt The Raven Remastered did surprise me and in the end it gets a big thumbs up from me."

Strategy|Real-Time|Defense|,"May 30, 2017",E10+,THQ Nordic,69,Digital Continue,Lock's Quest,tbd,"I bought this game because I remembered playing it on Nintendo DS as a kid and thought it would be fun to give it a chance. I remembered this game being hard and boy did I remember right. This game has no difficult setting and is pretty inconsistent in difficulty. Even some of the earliest levels in this game are pretty hard and you will fail multiple time. The game overall does get harder which becomes a problem later because some levels are too hard and I've even become stuck on one. after putting over 5 hours into one level and still being unable to pass it I've kinda given up. On top of the difficulty the game does have issues of crashing and just stop working at time. When you fail a level it'll give you 3 options. Retry the wave, reset the buildings for that wave, or reset the entire level. Occasionally the game will glitch and won't allow you to click any options forcing you to exit out of the game. The game also has a tendency to crash sometime. I got an average of 1 crash for maybe every 3 hours of gameplay. Not a huge issue but for a game so un-intense it shouldn't have this problem. The repair mechanic which is pretty important also is very hit or miss when it works. often it just won't work at all allowing the enemies to break through and making me lose. While i have complained for most of this review the gameplay is actually fun when it's working properly. And if the game was not $20 and somewhere between $5-10 I would recommend it. But because the game has many issues and is a bit overpriced for what you get I cannot recommend this game."

Thankfully my friends got it right and as far as bullet hell game’s go Earth Atlantis is a pretty decent addition to the genre. With these types of game’s you don’t tend to get much of a story, but Earth Atlantis doesn’t follow this usual formula. In fact the story in this game is not only fresh but it also remains interesting throughout your time with the game, which is great. One thing you will notice with this game is the amount of variety it has. There is literally a lot of variety dotted in all areas from the enemies to the places you visit and this meant that I hardly ever got bored when playing this game. I will say though that the game is best enjoyed when played in short periods because it can get a little repetetive, but on the whole this isn’t a major problem because the gameplay is easy to drift in and out of. Speaking about the gameplay I was very impressed with the simplistic approach they went with. This game is not complicated and you will find that by them doing it this way you can watch and enjoy each different mechanic freely without too much pressure being put onto you. This is a very good thing because the boss fights are challenging to say the least. I will admit that I think some of you will be put off by the challenge the bosses bring to you, but thankfully this wasn’t the case with me. I found each boss battle to be a very exciting affair and once I defeated a boss a got a great sense of achievement, which is awesome. In terms of gripes with the game I only really have one and that is the map system. The map system is very frustrating to say the least because it never seems to help you out and at times it’s hard to know where to go next which can harm the immersion levels a little bit. Thankfully though the immersion levels never dwindle too much thanks to the game’s excellent presentation. Visually the game has a very unique look to it and when you combine both the visuals and sound design together they end up making the adventure even more of an enjoyable experience. At the end of the day Earth Atlantis is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed and that’s mainly because they get the important aspects of the game spot on. It’s a game that is fun and challenging at the same time and if you have any interest in the bullet hell formula then I fully recommend that you give this game a try."

The story has awesome banter and is packed with humor and interesting as well complimented with multiple endings to each play through. There’s a good number of puzzles for you to solve and the variety within each one so completing them is quite rewarding. Getting use to the mechanics doesn’t take long as the tutorial gets you up to speed and all actions available are visible on screen to complete each task you need to accomplish. The number of duties you undertake can be a little overbearing at times they do ease you in gently at first and hey being a cop isn't easy. More variety in some of the missions would’ve been nice because the gameplay can feel somewhat a repetitive on some of the missions. Police style games are few and far between, so in its own way Beat Cop is unique and while the gameplay doesn’t have a ton of complexity to it, I still found myself very rarely getting bored. The story also helped keep boredom away because not only is it funny but it’s also interesting. The added bonus of multiple endings to the game’s story gives you a reason to return to a fresh play-through. If you’ve ever wanted to be a cop and write tickets, take bribes, or bust people with real life personal problems in the story effecting your decisions along the way, Beat Cop is perfect for you and in the end it was perfect for me because it never takes itself too seriously and offers you a fun adventure throughout your many plays of the games Thumbs up for sure, I'd think anyone who enjoys a throwback style with a good game behind it will agree."

There is a decent amount of variety present when it comes to the locations you can visit and this does make the game have some replay value. I really liked that you’re able to buy all of the fishing gear straight away instead of unlocking it because it keeps grinding down to a minimum. Each lake has character and fishing on them is a very relaxing and sometimes exciting experience. The game has a few bugs at the moment and whilst none of them are really major they can impact on your overall experience at times. I found the controls to be a little awkward most of the time and they didn’t always feel as tight and responsive as they should’ve been. There isn’t anything really wrong with the presentation side of the game there isn’t really anything that stands out either. Fishing game’s are niche in my opinion and I don’t know many people that really enjoy these types of game’s. Thankfully though I do enjoy them because I find them relaxing and peaceful and it takes me back to being a kid because I used to fish with my dad a lot when I was younger. As you can imagine then I did have some interest in Fishing Sim World and after playing it for a while I realised that it’s not a bad game at all, but it still does have a few shortcomings. Without a doubt my favourite thing about this game was its fishing mechanics and the reason why it was my favourite thing is because the mechanics had a nice realistic feel to them. I also liked the idea of being able to fish at a number of different locations and thankfully these locations have been done well even if the presentation side of the game is a little lacking at times. This however isn’t a big issue and when they sort out the awkward controls then I can see this being a game that I return to time and time again and for that reason the game does enough to get a recommendation because I personally love fishing games."

The moving and flying physics feel great and when you finally get the hang of them you get a very enjoyable and rewarding feeling. There is a decent amount of variety present in each of the levels and I liked how they eased me in when it came to the game’s different mechanics. While it can be a little bit too challenging from time to time I still think they did a good job of keeping the frustration levels down. Unfortunately the controls don’t always feel as tight and responsive as they should be which does cause you a few problems. Getting used to the camera takes quite a while because it seems to move when you least expect it culminating in some difficult moments. Technically the game suffers with a few issues every now and then which did impact on the immersion levels a little. I often find that when it comes to the platforming genre there isn’t enough games that truly challenge you. That being said there is a game that pops up every now and then that challenges you in a good way and The King’s Bird does just that. From the moment I started this game then I knew I was in for a challenge because the uniqueness of the movement and flying physics are hard to master at first. When you do get the hang of these physics though the rewarding feeling you get when you complete a level is off the charts. You will however have to deal with a few issues along the way though and I think the controls add some unnecessary problems due to them not always feeling as tight and responsive as they should. You also have to deal with a reckless moving camera as well because the camera does throw up a few bumps on the road to completing a level. I did however get used to this after a while and when I did I truly appreciated the variety in the levels and I also fell in love with the visuals and sound design because they did a fantastic job of making the gameplay come to life. At the end of the day then whilst The King’s Bird doesn’t offer you a perfect experience it still gets more right than it gets wrong and the uniqueness buried within it means fans of platformers will thoroughly enjoy what this game has to offer.

You lead a rebel faction, rationing resources and bartering, to obtain supplies to face the Nazis. Set in a realistic WWII Warsaw, you get to recruit from several different classes. The game features a brilliantly deep combat system that utilizes positioning, cover and permanent character death. Each side deploys on a two by four area, and a characters position on the field, determines what a character is capable of in a turn. You can also take a turn to move a character on the field, to take advantage of the layout. Each character has their own skill set, and everything is up-gradable. Managing your resources is a big element as well, and there are many of those to cover, but the most important is likely Ammo, as you're limited in how much you can carry, and use it for every attack. In fact I'd have to write an awful lot to explain this system in detail to you. This may be one of the best turn based combat systems I've have the fortune to play, but you have to really enjoy a deep combat system to truly appreciate it. The moving still art style really felt at home in the grim streets of Warsaw, and the soundtrack seals the ambiance and keeps the mood.

Blend the crowd of AI characters, track down other players, and use a number of different environment-specific rules to win the game. Walk like a robot and punch like a human being. Unspottable is a local multiplayer party game focused on deception. It's quite similar to the game Hidden in Plain Sight, except while the game focuses on more tactical, slow-paced gameplay, Unspottable focuses on quick and light-hearted gameplay. The basic concept of Unspottable involves players trying to fit in with a group of AI-controlled characters running around randomly. Each stage you are given a mission to accomplish, which is always a challenge to achieve without making it clear who you are. You can also win the round by reaching all the other human teams, so there are many pathways to Focusing on the challenge is a positive idea, but it still puts you at risk of being found out, because some players can want to track down others who do the task. It's a fun dichotomy that gives the game a lot of life and appeal to replay. Visually, the game is grim, but, considering the genre, it's passable. It's got a strange art style that doesn't work too well for me, but it's going to vary from person to person. The sound design is solid, but not the subject of the game, so it's barely noticeable.

Sitting down with a few friends to chase each other in a crowd of spectators may deliver some amusing moments, but the limits of the game may make them few and far between. Unspottable is everything you want from a couch party game. It's easy to pick up and enjoy, and there's a potential for all kinds of shenanigans. Other party games may offer more variety and, most importantly, multiplayer modes, but Unspottable sticks to its heart and is a lot of fun. So if you’re looking for a great couch party game, look no further and head directly to the Xbox digital games store and download it today!"

Adventure|Point-and-Click|,"Nov  7, 2017",E10+,Telltale Games,71,Telltale Games,Minecraft: Story Mode Season Two - Episode 4: Below the Bedrock,8.2,"Minecraft Story Mode Season 2 Episode 4 continues this series at a fairly strong pace along with a lot of new factors that both impressed me and disappointed me. Firstly lets start with the setting. As the title suggests 'Below the Bedrock', Jesse and his friends, have just escaped the Sunshine Institute where there only escape route is to venture even deeper underground beneath the bedrock to which we all thought was a vast world or darkness and emptiness. This episode has made us believe that the world of Minecraft Story Mode features an entirely different and forgotten world underneath the Bedrock where the Admin (Romeo) is the one responsible for concealing it and forcing everyone to believe that its empty. This setting like the Sunshine Institute does not stay subtle with the dark themes and yet adds some spookiness right at the start. Yet again we are introduced to a unique nightmarish mob; a giant Enderman. This mob made me feel as if it is there to not only try and kill us but also to annoy us as seen when we encounter it the second time. In the previous episode we met a character initially referred to as 'Prisoner X' and named Xara, where she is revealed to be a former Admin being the reason to why she seemed to know a lot about Romeo the real Admin and the escape route of the prison. While at first a very eerie character who was very reluctant on meeting Jesse, it seems that now all of a sudden she now thoroughly trusts us. Maybe this is just because of her previous personality before being imprisoned and having her friend and former admin Fred killed and still remains distraught but I cannot help thinking of this two-faced personality that Telltale abruptly created. The episode clearly shows her 'aggresive' emotions towards the loss of Fred but does it feel like we're friends all of a sudden? However during my two playthroughs of this episode where I made the opposite choices in the previous episodes as well as this one, I noticed that depending on one of the choices you make in regards to Xara she will either help you fight the mobs who try to impede your escape along with the giant enderman or she will ditch you like Jesse did before. To think that that final choice was completely useless, I guess not. Other new things that was featured in this episode included a trivia test. This is something I have always wanted since my first Telltale game (the Wolf Among Us) because despite being completely irrelevant to the storyline of most games, is something I always fabricated based off the 4 choice point and click style dialogue choices referencing the choice answers or a multiple-choice question. I was happy to see it in this episode but disappointed by the fairly lazy and indifferent way it was implemented into the game. This was a test based of supposed facts about Fred, the fallen leader of the community we were tasked to venture to and the former third Admin. In my first playthrough I did like how you need to free roam the town to learn and study some 'Fred facts' and thought that you need to do this to win the test and progress through the game where other free roam events in previous episodes you can just bypass. During my second playthrough I found out that I was wrong. Whether you pass the test or not, you still progress through the story in finding the weapon to defeating Romeo making the free roaming once again useless to the story. Or you could just wing the test as you have a 1 in 3 chance of getting the question right due to the dialogue choices given to you. How does Jesse even know these without even been given the options. Thankfully the trivia also featured a building contest through the newly introduced building mechanic which was a nice way to implement it into the episode and a lot better than that of the previous episode, but even with that whether you build from absolutely nothing to the coolest thing in the world, the round will end in a draw. So if you spend 2 hours on the episode just on the build, than that's just a waste of time. This episode actually managed to add a second build later on in the episode when you reach the town 'Romeosburg' which again is useless and not worth noting. What is worth noting however is the boss battle we get to do. In the last episode we were able to fight a unique creation of a ghast 'a three headed ghast', this time it was a giant magma golem. Not only was this an awesome design but a really cool and detailed way of defeating it involving water, mining and explosions (just see for yourself, you won't be disappointed). And yet again we are encountered with another battle with the giant enderman just before escaping via a portal and another difficult choice mainly involving which character(s) you will be with in the next episode. Overall, while not the most impressive entry in the series it still managed to keep me intrigued to the story and excited for what is to be a big and thrilling ending to this series. I just don't wanna 2 months again!"

Adventure|General|,"Apr  5, 2018",T,Bandai Namco Games,71,Mojo Bones,Impact Winter,tbd,"I’ve seen and heard mixed thoughts about Impact Winter since it released back in 2017 on the PC, but that didn’t stop me from looking forward to the game’s release on Xbox One because I quite like survival games. From the moment I started reviewing Impact Winter I realised straight away why it got mixed reviews because it gets some things right and it gets quite a few things wrong, but thankfully it got more things right than it got wrong. Obviously the most important aspect of this game is its survival elements and thankfully they’ve done a pretty good job here. The mechanics hold up really well and they do a good job of keeping you on your toes throughout. I was however expecting more depth from the survival side of the game and if you’re looking for more tasks and methods then there are better games out there for you to pursue. Thankfully though they combat the lack of depth in the survival aspect by offering you some decent quests. The quests in the game have a lot of variety going for them and that made each quest both interesting and exciting, which in turn makes you want to carry on and it also gives the game some replayability. There is a story that’s present as you make your way through the quests and sometimes it can be quite interesting, but it does have a drawback. The drawback is that there just isn’t enough of a story and this means the characters aren’t as interesting as they could’ve been, which is a shame. One thing they do make interesting though is the world in which the game takes place in. The world is full of secrets throughout and exploring the world is very fun because you don’t know what you will bump into along the way. Whilst I found the world very enjoyable you will come across a few technichal issues as you progress. None of these issues are game-breaking but there are quite a few of them and they can frustrate you which ultimately harms the immersion levels somewhat. That’s a shame because the presentation side of the game creates a lot of immersion and I really enjoyed this aspect of the game. The visuals and sound design combine together extremely well and without a doubt it gives Impact Winter a certain charm which stays with you throughout your time with the game. At the end of the day Impact Winter has many enjoyable moments for you to find and it’s a pretty decent game, but the shortcomings stop it from reaching its full potential and in the end there are better games for you to try out in the genre. Fans of the genre though will find a lot of things to satisfy them and most of its problems could be sorted out with a patch so it still does enough to get a recommendation from me."

Escher's deepest mind as rooms culminate together to form oddly shaped masses. There are openings that exude light, and those are where you need to go. The game is loaded with world puzzles, and items to collect in an attempt to reconstruct the real world. Every time you finish an area, you return to the room and the freefall. The game isn't very long, but it's seriously surreal. the ambient sound and light are entrancing, giving way to the immersive nature of the game. The controls are clean and simple, so it's easy enough to play. The game gives you no direction other than the first scene where you're directed to use the left stick to move the camera. I feel like a lot more could have been done with this game, as when you're finished, that's it. There isn't much replay value, but the adventure is worth checking out."

I must admit that I didn’t expect to enjoy this game as much and the main reason I enjoyed it so much is because it got a lot of the mechanics right. The puzzles which play a massive part in the game are absolutely perfect and the clever design plays a part in each individual puzzle. They have also managed to get the difficulty spot on and by doing this it means you don’t get frustrated very often when taking on the puzzles, which is great. Another important thing in a game like this is the controls and thankfully they remain both fluid and responsive throughout, which means you can focus solely on the tasks at hand without worrying about any problems. I must admit that I was surprised with the amount of content the game offers you and without a doubt you definitely get value for money. There are 75 levels for you tackle and some of them are pretty fun, but I would have liked to have had a little more variety with the level design. I would have also liked to have had a bit more in the way of a story and I think more of a story would have made the gameplay even better. The presentation side of the game pleased me a great deal and it also has the added bonus of stirring up some fond memories, especially when it came to the visuals. The visuals in the game have a real retro look to them and they complement the gameplay ever so well. At the end of the day Fearful Symmetry & The Cursed Prince is definitely a hidden gem. It’s a game that creates a very enjoyable experience and it makes you want to revisit time and time again, which is pretty rare with game’s like this. There is a little bit of everything in the game and this means that Fearful Symmetry will attract a number of different gamers. Also the price of the game is spot on and in a way undervalued and when it’s all said and done this game gets a massive thumbs up from me."

You associate a skill to one of 4 face buttons on your controller (or numbers 1-4 on your keyboard) and use them as such. Attack skills range from short (think swords) medium range) thrown items like bombs) and long ranged, (like lasers and sniper shots) with defensive skills doing things like blocking only attacks from the front, or all around, and some even reversing the attack back at your opponent. And this is just the basic aspects of the game, with a great many variations hidden within! Can you handle the fast action, and protect yourself from your opponents attacks, while dealing damage yourself, or will you fall, and become one with the dust?"

They have managed to nail a lot of the required mechanics and this makes the game both fun and very addictive. Another very good thing they’ve done is that they’ve included a lot of variety in a lot of areas, and this keeps things fresh and interesting throughout. There are multiple enemies for you to take on and each one has a unique quirk, and they allow you a number of different weapons for you to take these enemies on with. If you like a game that allows you to explore at your own pace then The Mummy Demastered has you covered. The world in the game is vast and there are lots of things for you to discover, which in turn gives the game some replay value. If you like an old-school challenge then this game will give you that as well. I liked the challenge but I must admit that some of the bosses were extremely difficult and I lost my cool quite a few times when taking them on. I would have also liked to have had my health restored when reaching save points, but unfortunately they don’t do that so prepare to die a lot. Responsive controls is very important in a game like this and thankfully they’ve done a wonderful job of keeping everything responsive. The presentation side of the game is awesome and I absolutely loved it. The visuals have a lovely looking old-school style and the accompanying soundtrack makes the game stand out a lot. At the end of the day whenever WayForward brings a game out I know I will love it because they always put a huge amount of effort into their product, and that’s exactly what they’ve done with The Mummy Demastered. This game will definitely keep you addicted and fans of retro style games will love playing this, in fact I think this game will create more fans of the old-school style. Without a shadow of a doubt this game gets a big thumbs up from me and its definitely one of the most enjoyable games I’ve played this year."

Each jigsaw puzzle has been designed extremely well and without a doubt the creativity that’s within them makes each jigsaw feel very fresh.In terms of content the game has just the right amount for me because it doesn’t grow old which means you don’t get frustrated nor bored. It features an easy to pick up and play style which means gamers of all ages can get involved and solve the various jigsaws that are on offer. For me I think they got the difficulty balance perfect because each puzzle contains a challenge. Once you complete the game there isn’t any real replay value. The controls feel a little clunky at times which can cause you to be a little distracted every now and then. I like nothing more than tackling an action-packed adventure it’s nice sometimes to deviate from that and instead try out a more relaxing experience. The problem is there isn’t too many of them games about so Glass Masquerade was a very welcome addition to the Xbox One game library. At its core then this game is all about solving jigsaw puzzles at your own pace and to say they’ve done these jigsaw puzzles extremely well would be a massive understatement. Every jigsaw feels fresh due to the variety that’s present within them and whilst it doesn’t have a huge amount of content for you to get to grips with there’s just enough to keep you satisfied whilst at the same time not overstaying its welcome. Everybody can get involved in this game as well because it features an easy to pick up and play style that can be enjoyed by everybody. The game also makes sure that each puzzle has got the perfect balance of being fun and challenging at the same time so you don’t come across many frustrating moments at all. In terms of problems the game for me only had one and that came in form of the controls feeling a little clunky at times, but thankfully I was easily able to look past this. At the end of the day then if you’re looking for a relaxing journey with a beautiful art style and sound design then Glass Masquerade is a game that you must experience because it does what it sets out to do perfectly.

Action|Adventure|General|Platformer|2D|,"Jul  5, 2019",E,Fantastico Studio,73,Fantastico Studio,Hero Express,tbd,"Hero Express was a nice surprise indeed. The presentation for a value priced game follows an Excitebike level of simplicity with a dash of the trials formula shown into a 2D side scrolling stunt racer that allows you to earn money for upgrades as you grind through your journey buying upgrades for your vehicle to get enough upgrades (and skill) to complete the courses at hand. You're awarded for picking up cash on the track along with bonus cash awarded for stunts performed during your run as well. The game is easy enough to understand for all age groups and levels of skill. While still provides enough fun to keep you coming back for more. The presentation is very nice and clean with nice tight controls, and a classic yet clean look, and a price of admission that will definitely please your budget. Along the track you will need to collect gas cans to refuel and other various objects like trash can which you can try to avoid or use a bottle of spray cleaner to clean the screen off if you happen to get the screen trashed. There's a solid variety of obstacles and challenges to tackle and your vehicle really is impacted by the upgrades and how it tackles the obstacles on the track which makes repeating tracks or making errors feel fun rather than cumbersome as you know after that next upgrade your going to be able to tackle what did you in on your last attempt. With the fun for all ages approach, solid presentation, easy to pick up and play style, and the content for your money this is one game I'd say is worthy to add to your Xbox One library. I can't remember the last time I had this much fun with a value priced game. Thumbs up Fantastico Studio!"

This game though has a stand alone story, so you don't have to have played the previous games to enjoy this installment. The game boasts about twenty hours of gameplay and is quite enjoyable. The story is interesting and it keep your interest. While the main story is about half the gameplay, and the character dynamics are quite strong. The scope of the story is about a brother trying to save his sister. The relationship between the brother and sister is a heart warming affair. The art style is well executed. The game is set in ancient China and we see a lot of interesting architectures and buildings. The game is also very immersive. The soundtrack is also very fitting and feel of ancient Chinese music is spot on. The mini games are well implemented too. The mini game is a type of chess and it is a lot of fun to play. The combat is ok but not overly great. The combat is fun and it does feel impactful. But the enemy AI is a bit meh. It is very easy to identify the enemy moves and exploit them. The main character is somewhat likeable but he is somewhat generic. The character models look good but they don't have dynamic facial expressions. The game introduces some famous historical characters, but the historical characters don't have major roles in the story. The character levelling system is atypical and refreshing in the RPG genre, but it feels under utilized due to the length of the game. The level designs are quite linear. There is hardly any detour in the levels themselves. The occasional branching paths are mostly for treasure chests. Therefore, for the most of the game you are just running straight from point A to point B. The side missions are boring and they don't impact the story itself. There aren't enough cosmetic items for your character. The good of Xuan Yuan Sword 7 most definitely outweighs the mixed bag. Overall Xuan Yuan Sword 7 is a great game and the story is compelling. With all said and done it’s definitely worth the price of admission so if you’re looking for a game in this genre look no further and head on over to the Xbox digital games store and give it a go."

Strategy|General|,"Oct 17, 2017",T,Kalypso,72,Realmforge Studios,Dungeons 3,7.8,"I’m a big fan of the Dungeons series and I have had quite a lot of enjoyment on both the previous games, but in my opinion the previous games lacked polish but thankfully this has been rectified a lot in Dungeons 3. I found the campaign to be more interesting in this game, and the variety in each mission keeps things fresh and interesting throughout. I was also impressed with the difficulty curve in the game because they ease you in gently and this in turn makes the game more accessible to all gamers. Dungeons 3 does however have a few limitations and the biggest limitation for me was the population you can have, and in my opinion it would have been better if they allowed you to have more of a population. The story in the game continues to be interesting and the added humour never outstays its welcome because the humour is actually pretty funny. The gameplay as ever has been done really well. Each different mechanic in the game works really well, and this in turn keeps the gameplay fun and exciting throughout. At times the game does suffer with some technical issues though but none of these issues really impact the game’s drawing power instead they just cause a slight annoyance. The presentation side of the game is where the game has seen the most polish. Visually the game has a nice amount of detail, and the sound design does a very good job of making you become immersed in the game. At the end of the day in my opinion Dungeons 3 is definitely the best game in the series so far. There is still a few niggling problems that remain, but they have managed to improve in most areas and that is certainly the case with the amount of polish the game has had put into it. Fans of these types of games will absolutely love this addition and for the amount of effort the game has had put into certain areas it definitely gets a big thumbs up from me."

Adventure|Point-and-Click|,"Sep 15, 2020",M,Assemble Entertainment,72,Assemble Entertainment,Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Don't Dry,tbd,"Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Don't Dry is Crazy Bunch Studio’s revival of this beloved adult themed adventure series. There's many callbacks to yesteryear of cartoony stylized adventures. It’s out there; cynical, blunt and crude. A Leisure Suit Larry game wouldn't be complete without these traits. This time around, Larry is a fish out of water in the digital age, waking up in a strange lab, decades after his last big ordeal. He immediately gets involved in the on-line dating world after making a profile on the Timber app. For reasons only his libido is aware of, he needs to lure the assistant of Bill Jobs, CEO of tech company Prune. First off if you're easily offended well than, this is not the game for you. The humor is a grotesque caricature of masculinity; a nasally-sounding, slimy, that’s as incompetent as he is lucky. Almost every dialogue set has a joke that a teenager might try to make his friends laugh with. The writers know their audience well and you can't even start the game without answering retro questions to prove your age to begin. It was always going to be a dicey proposition bringing back a series synonymous with video game based low taste sexual humor, starring you (or Larry) a womanizing sleaze-bag straight out of a time best forgotten. Thankfully Leisure Suit Larry: Wet Dreams Don’t Dry manages to balance a tone that’s true to it's roots. The fun poked at social media, online dating, and trends would have felt outdated upon the game’s original release although this isn't the 1st of the series to make it to an Xbox console. A lot of the over the top jokes did raise a smile from me. The story is just enough, centering on a tech company and taking shots at shady game development habits. The game looks and sounds great, with gorgeous hand-drawn artwork and fantastic voice acting. The characters are like-able enough. Overall, this is an adult enjoyable entry in a very niche genre of gaming. Definitely worth picking up for fans of the classic series."

Once there Edward realizes something sinister, and tragic happened here. Without giving out spoilers, we'll say the end is the best part of Draugen. With it's few twists and turns in the story, the game unfortunately simply leaves us wanting in the end, as the game feels more like an interactive (barely) graphic novel more than a game. With very little left for you to deduce on your own, you'll follow along with Edward and Alice as they unravel some of the happenings that took this small village. The scenery is incredible, breathtaking, and rich, only to be enhanced by the ambient soundtrack. The voice acting is obviously well-intended and you can tell the actors are giving it their heart. The rigid character models and animations, unfortunately, detract from the rest of the beauty you see in this narrative.

Action Adventure|Open-World|,"Jun  6, 2018",E,Hollow Tree Games,72,Seaven Studio,Shape of the World,tbd,"Sometimes there’s nothing better than playing a nice relaxing game because at times you need a rest from the stressful and challenging game’s that are everywhere. Unfortunately though these types of game’s don’t hold your attention for very long but when they do you end up having a very immersive experience. Shape of the World may not be the best game in the world and it may have a few shortcomings, but it got more things right than it got wrong and in the end the uniqueness and charm made the game very enjoyable. The uniqueness the game has comes from its mechanics. These mechanics combine together extremely well and doing the nature-based aspects really do make you have a worthwhile experience for the most part. Unfortunately though there just isn’t enough to do in the game so that means that things can start to get a little repetetive and tedious, but thankfully the puzzles that are present in the game do ease that a little bit. The puzzles certainly have a creative edge to them and whilst none of them are really challenging in any way they do a very good job of keeping the gameplay fresh and in a way interesting. Without a doubt the best way to enjoy this game is by exploring. Exploring really allows you to see the true beauty of the fantastic world in which the game’s set and the best thing is that the game doesn’t hold you back so you’re free to explore what you want and where you want at all times. I would however have liked to have seen a story included when exploring because even though exploring can be fun and interesting a story would’ve given the game a true meaning and in my opinion a decent narrative makes any game accessible to a more gamers. Another thing that the game doesn’t really have is content. In terms of content there isn’t a huge amount for you to get to grips with and the worst thing is that once the game is completed you’re highly unlikely to return back to it, which is a shame because the content that is here is pretty good and more replaybility would’ve been something that I would’ve loved. Without a doubt my favourite thing about this game was its presentation. Visually the game can look stunning at times and there’s nothing better than seeing the world come alive in all areas. The music and sound design also play a big part in this game and when these aspects combine with the visuals the immersiveness can be off the charts at times. At the end of the day Shape of the World is a game that won’t be for everybody, but if like me you like game’s that give you a nice relaxing and sometimes mysterious adventure then you will really like what this game has to offer because in the end it can be really different from the other game’s out there."

Action Adventure|General|,"Feb 13, 2018",T,Over The Moon,74,Over The Moon,The Fall Part 2: Unbound,7.8,"First of all, I was a massive fan of the first game and that was mainly because it had a unique story and it had many exciting moments littered throughout. Thankfully The Fall Part 2: Unbound is a fantastic continuation of the series and without a doubt it satisfied me a great deal. The story is once again the thing that stands out most. Everything about the story is fantastic and the best thing is that it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. One of the reasons the story is so successful is because the characters in the game are a joy to behold and for me they are some of the best characters I’ve ever come across in a game. When it comes to the gameplay that’s on offer in the game you will notice a number of different mechanics in play at the same time, and thankfully most of these different mechanics hold up really well. I never found myself getting bored with the gameplay, but I would have liked a little more variety when it came to the combat in the game. Don’t get me wrong the combat isn’t bad but I would have liked them to have made it a little less frustrating. Once again there are an abundance of puzzles for you to get to grips with in the game, and thankfully some of these puzzles are amazing. What you will notice is that each puzzle matters and the clever design of each puzzles makes completing them very rewarding. There isn’t much bad about this game but I will say that it does suffer with a few technical issues every now and then, but a small patch would sort this out easily. In terms of the presentation side of the game it ticked a lot of boxes for me. Visually the game has a dark sinister side to it and I think it creates a very unique atmosphere. The sound design also manages to create a unique atmosphere as well and I thought the voice actors did a wonderful job with their roles. At the end of the day Over The Moon have done a wonderful job with part 2 of this fascinating series, and in some ways they’ve even made it better than the first game. Everything about this game just feels right and when everything that’s right combines together it delivers a very memorable experience. If you enjoyed the first game then The Fall Part 2: Unbound is an absolute must buy and I can’t wait to see what the series has planned for us next."

Simulation|Flight|Combat|,"Jul 10, 2018",E10+,Curve Digital Games,74,Runner Duck,Bomber Crew,6.2,"There have been a ton of World War II game’s that have come out over the year’s and for me it’s one of my favourite settings. As you can imagine then whenever a game has a World War II theme I’m very eager to get to grips with it and the best thing about the new game Bomber Crew that’s made its way to the Xbox One is that it focuses on the flying side of war. Decent flying game’s are very few and far between and thankfully Bomber Crew can be added to the decent flying game’s list despite the shortcomings it suffers with. One thing that impressed me right from the get go were the strategy elements the game boasts. Each move and little different thing you do matters in the long run so when you end up completing a mission you end up getting a great sense of achievement. This sense of achievement though also has some frustrating moments thrown in as well because the game’s difficulty curve can be quite difficult at times. The awkward controls also don’t help when it comes to the frustration levels as well and you’ll find that it will take you quite a while to get used them. When you do get used to them though you will be pleased with the amount of content that’s available to you. There is more than enough to keep you satisfied for quite a while and even though the missions do get repetetive after a while completing them still gives you a nice little rush. As you progress through the various missions the game delivers a number of different upgrades and unlockables to you and without a doubt obtaining each different upgrade is worth it which means the game does have quite a bit of replayability. Whilst I was impressed with the upgrades and unlockables some of them do require a lot of grinding to obtain and this can make things become a little tedious and repetetive. I must admit though that I was glad I carried on despite the repetetiveness because each upgrade did make the game a little easier, which is great. On the presentation side of things Bomber Crew isn’t going to win any awards but I actually enjoyed what was on offer here. Visually the game has a nice cute cartoony style and the accompanying sound design combines well with these visuals making the gameplay even more fun in a way. At the end of the day Bomber Crew has quite a few interesting mechanics in play at the same time and in a way this does give the game a little bit of uniqueness. This uniqueness means that you can look past the game’s imperfections and in the end you end up having quite an enjoyable time with Bomber Crew."

Miscellaneous|Exercise / Fitness|,"Nov 19, 2013",E,Majesco Games,73,Zoe Mode,Zumba Fitness World Party,6.2,"Zumba is a fantastic game for those who want to have a variety of music and culture in their dancing game, and a fun one to boot. It's a bit more forgiving than Just Dance 2014, so when you hear the music and see the dance patterns it usually gives credit where credit is due, unless you aren't moving of course. If you're looking for household names and pop stars, then look away; this set-list is attune to just the music going to the moves, as well as Zumba original music. That said it's all very fun, there's a solid variety to the songs, and once you find some that you like, you're pretty hooked. Zumba has some incredibly frustrating kinect controls, it was a huge mistake not to implement use of the controller to navigate menus. Also with multiple players, the kinect has a difficult time linking a gamertag to the person, and when you want to sign in to continue your workout progress it becomes very tedious. My only other complaint is that I wish the setlist were a little bit more than 44 songs, but at the same time that's hardly anything to rag on, considering the replay-ability on most of the songs.  If you're looking for a game to dance to and maybe get something out of it, Zumba hits the right notes, it'll make you sweat after a few songs, the music is fun, and it really moves every part of your body. Just make sure you have the patience to tolerate the kinect and it's few shortcomings."

Action|Shooter|Shoot-'Em-Up|Horizontal|,"May 11, 2018",E,Huey Games,73,Four5Six Pixel,Hyper Sentinel,tbd,"Retro games are games that I hope never die because I have a lot of fond memories about them. Nowadays you don’t see as many retro titles make their way to consoles so when a new game comes out I’m all over it like a rash. The new game in question is called Hyper Sentinel and it screams retro throughout and without a doubt I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game. In fact I can see this being a game I revisit time and time again thanks to its very addictive gameplay. The gameplay is simple to understand and hard to master and it always makes you want to play that one extra game, which is great. Playing that one extra game isn’t a problem because thankfully in terms of content the game has more than enough to keep you satisfied. You will however notice that the levels you play don’t have much in terms of variety, and whilst it would’ve been nice to have some more variety I was able to look past this because of the boss battles. Each boss provides you with a very good challenge and defeating them gives you a great sense of achievement and the best thing is that I very rarely got frustrated tackling them. Instead the frustrating moments came from tackling multiple enemies at the Same time. The main reason why this can be frustrating at times is because it’s hard to see what is going on because sometimes there’s a lot happening on the screen and this will cause you a few deaths here and there. Thankfully though you can combat this by using one of the many power-ups that are on offer. I really enjoyed using these upgrades because they actually help you a great deal and there’s no greater feeling than destroying multiple enemies at the same time. Once again they go for a simple approach here with the upgrades and overall the controls are simple throughout. I must admit that I was really impressed with the controls that had been implemented because they remain tight and responsive throughout your time with the game, which for me is very important in a game like this. Another thing that’s important for me in a game like this is the presentation side of things, and thankfully they’ve got this aspect spot on. The visuals and sound design are very retro indeed and when they both combine together they provide you with even more fun and enjoyable moments, which is great. At the end of the day if you’re a fan of old-school fast paced shooters then you will thoroughly enjoy Hyper Sentinel. The developers have done a wonderful job of creating an old-school experience with a modern touch and this in turn makes things fun and enjoyable for both veterans of the genre and newcomers as well."

Gameplay wise this offers plenty of hours for you to sink your teeth into and with a feature called ""procedural generation"" for content new different content is generated each playthrough.  This game is a Sci-Fi RPG turn based card combat exploration game, that oddly works quite well together.  I felt the game needed to explain some things better as I felt suddenly left in the lurch after just minor explanations, while you do eventually figure it out that feeling was a massive detrement to the game along with the dialog on screen can pass before you can fully read it. Visually Deep Sky Derelicts serves us a gloomy futuristic dynostopian comic vibe and pulls it off wonderfully, in fact this is probably what I love most about the game. The controls work as intended, during exploration using just a single button and during combat the lesser used buttons are clearly marked for user ease. However I find the UI rather clumpy and probably could have been made more user friendly. Overall: This I find is a great game but could have been executed a bit more player friendly for those new to this style of game, the hard work and dedication clearly shows. It's short comings made up for visually and with the potential replay value."

In fact it’s without a doubt the best aspect of the game and that’s pretty impressive considering the game doesn’t get too much wrong at all. Obviously a story wouldn’t be as good if it didn’t have good presentation and thankfully I’m pleased to say that both the visuals and sound design shine brightly at all times.

Action Adventure|General|,"Mar  2, 2018",T,Lienzo,73,Lienzo,Mulaka,6.2,"I love games that teach and give you information about different cultures because it’s fascinating to learn about their way of life, and if done right this can make the game a very enjoyable and immersive experience. Mulaka does get this right at times and if it didn’t suffer with the shortcomings it has then it would be an even better game. The world in which the game takes place in is absolutely fantastic in my opinion. Exploring the world never seemed tedious and it has a decent size to it, so you can enjoy yourself somewhat. You will notice however that the more you explore the more technichal issues the game suffers with, and whilst none of these are major issues they can still be a nuisance at times. The gameplay that’s on offer in Mulaka has a decent variety to it and when all the mechanics click together you end up having some enjoyable combat and puzzles to sink your teeth into. Unfortunately though the controls can be a little awkward at times and the movement can also feel a little awkward and that can take away from the fun factor every now and then. Without a doubt my favourite thing about this game were the boss battles. The boss battles were absolutely awesome and the thought and effort that has gone into them is evident from the get go, and by doing this they’ve made each different boss stand out. The same can also be said about the other enemies you face and the amount of variety is excellent when it comes to the enemy design. The game unfortunately isn’t blessed when it comes to the amount of content it has and in my opinion it was a little on the short side, and I definitely would have liked to have been able to do a little more. The lack of content means the game doesn’t have much in terms of replayability so once completed your highly unlikely to return back to it. The presentation side of the game is something that ticked a lot of boxes for me. Visually the game has a lot of unique charm and the art style can look beautiful at times. The sound design has also been done well and it does a very good job of drawing you into the game. At the end of the day I appreciate the effort that has gone into Mulaka and if it didn’t have the niggling problems it has it would have definitely gotten a higher score from me. That being said despite its problems it does provide you with a very enjoyable experience and for that reason it does enough to get a thumbs up from me."

There is eight or nine levels in each series, two of them being boss stages. Also you need to collect coins in non-boss levels to unlock the next levels in each series. There is another collectible in the game as well via blue tickets. Usually they are hidden behind invisible walls or out of the normal way. By collecting blue tickets you can unlock the bonus episodes in the special features section of the level select menu. You can replay the level if you missed any of the collectibles and the collectibles you already collected will be transparent. The in level HUD tells you how many you have collected and how many coins or tickets you have left to collect. Gameplay is moving, jumping and burp. You can kill some enemies with normal jump, for other enemies first you stun them with burp and then you kill him with jump on the head. Each series has one or more extra mechanics and that changes the gameplay a bit, as well how they used the mechanics in each boss level.

Despite the voice acting being a little lacklustre at times (or not present), I found the presentation side of the game to be very impressive and most important of all throwback to long time favorites with an extended journey and easy to manage inventory system and skill tree. All in all the Warhammer franchise is fantastic, it has a long history of varied game play. To say then that I was looking forward to Warhammer: Chaosbane would be quite the understatement and being a fan of the series earlier mentioned I was excited and found a very enthralling experience in the end. The entertainment was experienced almost immediately as I plugged head first into battle looting and hunting for better gear with each drop. The customization of combat elements and the skills you can upgrade provides a huge amount of customization you can change on the fly and even the same class of character can feel very different from the decisions you make in their abilities. Using your abilities when in combat is always fun as well because there is a decent amount of varied enemies for you to face around every corner. The boss battles are great and defeating them was so rewarding especially when cranking up the difficulty. In terms of problems the game has a few that aren’t too bothersome but there is an issue that disappointed me a little and that is the number of times I had to revisit certain areas within a new mission. Warhammer: Chaosbane tickled my fancy despite it could have been better in a few areas. I'm looking forward to the additional content coming in the season pass and how in depth the evolution of the game will take us. Overall a fabulous game and a must buy for any fan of the genre."

I've never played another RTS quite like this one! From the wonderful comic book feeling animation, and beautifully rendered worlds, to the ever looming feel of dread, They are Billions never lets you out of it's cold iron grasp. Once you've played (and likely died) a few times, you quickly realize that one mistake, or oversight could be your end. Game play itself is straight forward, You need people, and energy to run everything, while keeping everyone fed, and gathering the materials you need to build more, and researching better buildings, and keeping a stock of soldiers for your defensive lines. Just like any good RTS you can easily under-produce nearly anything, keeping you from making the next great structure, so be sure to try and keep everything just above ""What you need"" and you'll be a bit better off. The slim choices in units and proceduraly generated maps can make early game a bit harsh, especially for newer players. The feeling of dread produced the first time a real Horde attack trudges it's way from the Fog of War is real, they feel like Billions! But that doesn't even scratch the 'Final horde' that comes at the end of days, set by your difficulty. The game is HARD. There is no Tutorial. If you are NEW to RTS style games then this may not be the best choice for you to start on.

Over the past couple of years the MotoGP franchise has seen quite a few significant improvements implemented which have made them much more enjoyable.  MotoGP 19 has carried on the improvement, and I'd say this is the most realistic experience that’s been delivered by Milestone to date. This immersive feeling is enhanced thanks to the very realistic and challenging gameplay which might I add gives you a great sense of achievement when you finally win a race, especially when challenging players online. Winning a race might take you a while though because the simulation present is challenging, so expect a few frustrating moments as you learn the ropes. When you do get the feel of the controls, it will make you appreciate the refined bike physics and it will also make you impressed with just how clever the AI is. MotoGP 19 has a lot for you to play, so expect it to consume a quality amount of your time. The overall content is very good but a few minor issues to deal with on occasion. None of these bugs are too problematic and I’m sure these will be easily fixed with a patch. MotoGP 19 is another step in the right direction for the series, it isn’t perfect but it gets so much right that you tend to forget about the little issues and instead all you end up focusing on the very realistic, competitive, and immersive racing. MotoGP 19 is definitely the best in the series, hopefully we will see even more improvements in any updates to the game and in 2020."

Miscellaneous|Action Adventure|General|,"Feb  7, 2018",T,Armor Games,75,Armor Games,Pinstripe,8.0,"Pinstripe is one of those rare games that makes you think about it long after completion. It stirs up a number of emotions throughout your playthrough and that’s mainly down to its fantastic story. The story grips you straight away and never lets go and in the end you genuinely care about the characters because they’ve been designed and implemented brilliantly. Another thing that stands out is the world in which the game takes place. Everything in the world feels alive and there are plenty of secrets to find which gives the game a little bit of replayability. In terms of the gameplay that’s present in the game you will find some of it pretty enjoyable. The platforming elements of the game play very well and most importantly the controls feel fluid and responsive throughout. There is also a decent amount of puzzles to sink your teeth into as well. Most of the puzzles in the game have been designed really well and I was very impressed with the amount of variety the puzzles had. Pinstripe also has a little bit of combat included in its gameplay, but I found this aspect to be a little lacklustre. The main reason why I wasn’t much for the combat is because everything about it felt awkward and it ended up being frustrating more than anything. In terms of content the game is short, but in my opinion I found the length of the game to be perfect. It doesn’t overstay its welcome and if you want more then you will get more playthroughs if you want to find all of the secrets. If you want to do this though then you’ll have to prepare for a lot of backtracking and if you’re like me then you will find this a tad tedious at times. The presentation side of the game is absolutely stunning in my opinion. Visually the game looks great and looks alive at all times and the accompanying sound design is fantastic, and I must admit that I was especially impressed with the voice actors who I thought did a wonderful job of bringing an emotional side to the game. At the end of the day Pinstripe will no doubt surprise a lot of people and it surprised me as well because I didn’t think it would be this good. They have managed to combine a fantastic story with wonderful characters and also throw in some clever puzzles as well and this without a doubt creates a memorable experience. If you’re a fan of puzzle platformers then Pinstripe is a must buy and if you’re newcomers to the genre then I highly recommend you try this game first."

The developers have made the game very fun and addictive and most important of all is it’s very rewarding, which is great. In the game there are four characters for you to try out and trying them out was very fun. Each character has had a lot of thought and effort put into them and the variety each character has keeps things fresh throughout. The gameplay on the whole is super addictive and has loads of interesting concepts in play at the same time. You would expect the gameplay to be complicated because of this, but thankfully they keep things simple which makes the game accessible to a lot of gamers. Whilst it may be simple in its approach it does however get a tad too difficult at times and the difficulty seems to spike out of nowhere which can be a little frustrating at times. Thankfully though the progression system makes you forget about the difficulty and makes you determined to carry on. I say this because the progression system has been done to perfection and the best thing is that it delivers you tons of replay value. Those who are fans of the strategy side of game’s may be a little disappointed here because there isn’t much in terms of variety here unfortunately. Something that really surprised me about the game though was how fun and charming the story was. The story remains interesting throughout and the way they tell the story has a unique feel to it, which is great. The presentation side of the game ticked a lot of boxes for me and I was especially fond of the visuals. The pixel-art visuals fit the game’s style very well and the accompanying sound design also holds up really well. At the end of the day I love it when a game reaches my lofty expectations and thankfully that’s exactly what Full Metal Furies does. You can tell from the get go that a lot of love and effort has gone into the game and this makes everything about the game stand out in a good way. It’s both fun and addictive when playing on your own or with friends and the simplicity of the game means things never get too frustrating, which is something that I really liked, and without a doubt Full Metal Furies gets a massive thumbs up from me."

Thankfully on the whole it performs pretty well and it does provide you with quite a few enjoyable moments but it doesn’t come without its problems as well. It does however get more things right than it gets wrong and when played with friends you end up having a huge amount of fun. The online components in the game work really well and I didn’t suffer with many problems at all. In fact the only real problem the online multiplayer suffers with is that the servers are a little empty so finding a game can be a little bit difficult at times. When you do get into a game though the gameplay can be very addictive and there is a great deal of variety in certain areas. One of the areas that has the most variety present is when it comes to the weapons you can use in the game. Each weapon has its pros and cons and they’re all fun to use and this definitely keeps things fresh and interesting for longer. Another aspect of the game that has a great deal of variety is the customisation that you’re allowed to do. You can chop and change a number of different things and this amount of freedom means no game ever plays the same, which in turn gives the game quite a bit of replay value. I will however recommend that you play the game in short bursts especially if you’re playing on your own because the missions can get a little reptetive after a bit. You will also have to deal with a high difficulty curve when playing alone and this will be off-putting for some, but I suggest that you ride it out because you will become more powerful as you progress through the game. Without a doubt one of my favourite things about the game was the presentation that has been implemented. If you like a retro look with a modern feel then this game will tick a lot of boxes for you. This look gives the game quite a bit of charm and I must admit that the visuals and sound design combined together extremely well culminating in even more fun being delivered to you. All in all this game does what it sets out to do and this is to deliver you a fun and enjoyable experience and on the whole the game works really well but I can’t help thinking that the game’s problems stop it from reaching its full potential. That being said it does enough to keep fans of this specific genre satisfied and it does enough to get a thumbs up from me."

Action Adventure|General|,"Jul 17, 2018",T,Team17,75,Reinkout Games,Mugsters,tbd,Mugsters can be a game like no other at times because in a way it has a number of different genre’s in play at the same time and thankfully for the most part they all combine together really well. At it’s core though this game is a sandbox puzzler and even though it isn’t perfect and it suffers with a few shortcomings here and there on the whole this game can be an incredible amount of fun when in full flow. Once you start the game and eventually work out what to do you realise how simple it is but the simplicity doesn’t hold it back in fact in a way it makes the game even more addictive. I will say though that some of you will be frustrated at the start because there’s no tutorial telling you what to do and an inclusion of a small tutorial would’ve been a nice addition in my opinion. Thankfully though the lack of a tutorial isn’t too much of a problem though and you will easily get the hang of it after a short amount of time. If you like solving puzzles then you will absolutely adore this game and the best thing is that each puzzle provides you with quite a bit of a challenge. Thankfully though the puzzles don’t ever become frustrating and the clever design of each puzzle means they stay fresh and interesting at all times. Technichally the game holds up really well and I was especially impressed with the physics in the game which had a fun and realistic feel to them. This means then that the game is fun when playing on your own or with friends. I would recommend though that you play this game with friends because even though there is fun to be had when playing on your own the game just seems to come alive more when played with friends. Unfortunately though you can only play with friends locally because there is no online component included and in my opinion this is a shame because I think an online component would’ve benefited the game a lot. Another thing that would’ve benefited the game in my opinion would’ve been the inclusion of a story because they’ve got the perfect setting for a story. Speaking about the setting the presentation side of the game ticks a lot of boxes for me. Visually the game has a lot of charm packed in all areas and the sound design whilst simple combines with the visuals extremely well. At the end of the day Mugsters is one of them game’s that’s perfect to play at a party. It’s a game that never takes itself too seriously and in the end the enjoyment it delivers to you makes you forget about the game’s imperfections leading to me giving the game a thumbs up.

Trapped on a cruise ship that's sailed into another dimension, most of the people on the ship have become mindless thralls. The most satisfying part of the game are those victory blows that finish your fights. The game is your usual RPG Strategy formula, search the areas for items, leave most of them behind due to your limited inventory, then move on to the next fight. The worst part of this limited inventory is everything has a durability that drains each time you hit or get hit. This can lead to the biggest dread in the game, stuck in a battle with nothing left because all your gear has broken. The story is kind of lacking, but it gets the job done. As far as Strategy is concerned, there isn't much depth to that. Most battles are beat the enemy down as fast as possible and move on to the next one. The overall pace to the game is fairly relaxed for a Rouge-Lite, letting you move along at your own pace for the most part. The long loading times lend to this relaxed feel, as they are fairly hefty. The game isn't bad, and will keep you pressing on again and again, but don't expect a lot of depth to this nautical adventure and it will be a smooth sail."

The different scenarios you can achieve in the game have been well done and they keep you intrigued throughout your time with the game. I liked the presentation side of the game because they do a good job of keeping things simple and to the point in both the visuals and sound design. Each different mechanic that’s present in the game has been implemented extremely well and with this comes a touch of realism. It has an easy to pick up and play style and the tutorial the game delivered to me made me feel confident when approaching the main game. Technically the game suffers with a few issues every now and then which can harm the immersion of levels a bit at times. The difficulty curve can be a problem at times and it’s quite easy to become bankrupt which does cause you to suffer some frustration. As far as the management sim genre goes Project Highrise: Architect’s Edition is a very good addition because its attention to detail is off the charts. This is a game that have been looking forward to on the Xbox One because I’ve heard a lot of good things about the PC version and thankfully I’m pleased to say that it was worth the wait. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this game has an almost endless amount of replayability and I’ve no doubt that you’ll be very satisfied with the content that’s available to you. I also have no doubt that you’ll be satisfied with each different mechanic as well and whilst the game suffers with a few technichal issues every now and then I was easily able to look past them because the different scenarios kept me so intrigued from start to finish. Frustration doesn’t rear its head very often in this game even though the difficulty curve can be a problem at times and that’s mainly because it features an easy to pick up and play style and a decent tutorial to go along with it. This then means that Project Highrise: Architect’s Edition may bring new fans to the genre and if you’re already a fan of these types of game’s then I thoroughly recommend that you check this game out.

Hellmut: The Badass from Hell is a shooter and the main goal is to defeat every varied enemy that appears similar to the classic Gauntlet in regards to killing spawning enemies. The premise sounds simple enough, but don’t let that fool you because the game definitely packs quite the challenge. I enjoy games that challenge me, and Hellmut: The Badass from Hell has an excellent balance of fun at the same time. The only real frustration I had from Hellmut: The Badass from Hell was the fact that obtaining some of the items does require  a bit of grinding. Grinding won't be a problem if played in shorter sessions, because the game features an array of different characters that all have their own uniqueness about them. Playing as each character is fun because of the uniqueness each provides in it's own way. Hellmut: The Badass from Hell has a few technical issues but it still gets more right than it gets wrong. Looking past the lack of content and lack of depth in the gameplay shouldn’t be much of an issue, especially to fans of games of the genre. Hellmut: The Badass from Hell might not be the best shooter available on the Xbox One, but it’s definitely a decent addition to the genre and if you’re a fan of these types of games then you’ll definitely enjoy what it offers. It takes you on an action-packed journey filled with lots of hellish moments thanks to the fantastic art-style and sound design. So go to hell and back with Hellmut: The Badass from Hell on your Xbox One and enjoy the ride."

Despite the retro vibe, Timespinner is not a clone as it introduces its own unique mechanics as you progress and the mechanics do make the gameplay more interesting and give it depth. Timespinner's combat always felt fresh no matter how many times you ended up in combat. I would however have liked to have been challenged a little more because the variety of weapons you can use made defeating the creative bosses feel almost too easy. I would’ve also enjoyed being able to explore a more which it isn’t always possible due to the map size present in game.

Strategy|Real-Time|MOBA|,"Apr 10, 2018",E10+,Focus Home Interactive,74,Passtech Games,Masters of Anima,tbd,"Strategy games are either something you love or hate and the people that hate them won’t find anything in Masters of Anima that will change your mind, in fact it will probably make you hate this specific genre even more. Don’t get me wrong it’s not a bad game by any means and it did provide me with some enjoyable moments but in the end it suffers with a few glaring problems that stop it from being placed in the higher echelons of strategy games. It does however get some aspects I consider important right, and I especially found that to be the case with the controls. The controls in the game are thankfully simple and most importantly they remained responsive throughout, which was a relief because the game is very unforgiving. In my opinion the difficulty curve is way too high and I found this to harm the fun factor quite a lot which is a shame because I did enjoy some of the content that was present in the game. Speaking about content there is quite a lot for you to get to grips with and when you finally manage to get past the hard-core difficulty you will find yourself having quite a few enjoyable moments. Unfortunately though these moments don’t seem to last long and that’s mainly down to the tedious combat in the game. The main reason why I’ve labelled the combat tedious is because everything about it feels slow and clunky and in the end you just end up getting bored, which is a shame. The enemies also don’t help when it comes to the combat side of things and that’s mainly down to each enemy pretty much playing out the same way and the lack of variety becomes quite noticeable almost immediately. Thankfully there is something that does have quite a bit of variety and that thing is the story. I found the story to be very charming and it kept me interested more than I thought it would and I think that was because the story has a nice amount of humour included. Another thing I found to be charming about the game was the presentation. The visuals and sound design are perfect in my opinion and in a way they make the game have a unique edge to it, which is great. At the end of the day Masters of Anima could have been so much more and it would’ve been much more if it didn’t have the problems it unfortunately has.

Action|Platformer|3D|,"Jan 25, 2019",E10+,Anticto,74,Anticto,Steamroll,tbd,"I was very impressed with the puzzles in the game because they always seemed to throw up something new and the design of each of them was very clever. In terms of content there is a decent amount for you to get to grips and the variety that’s present means that getting through it isn’t a chore. Each different mechanic in the game has been done well and the best thing is that each mechanic is interesting which keeps repetitiveness on a low level. The controls react extremely well and they’re fluid and responsive at all times which means any mistake is purely down to you and down to you only. There isn’t really anything that stands out in both the visuals and sound design meaning the presentation is very forgettable and lacks flare and overall excitement. Technically the game suffers with a couple of issues every now and then which can frustrate you a little. While the story can be good at times on the whole there just isn’t enough within it to keep things interesting. I didn’t know too much about Steamroll before playing it, Thankfully the puzzles were a nice surprise. At its core then this game focuses mainly on puzzles but that’s not all it has because it does have a few other interesting mechanics in play as well. This then means the game has plenty of variety within its content and there’s more than enough content to keep you satisfied as well which means you do get good value for your money. In terms of problems the game does have a few though so you won’t be getting a perfect experience. Thankfully though the problems aren’t too severe and if you’re one of those people who don’t mind a basic presentation and a few technical issues along the way then you’ll be able to easily look past these issues when it comes to the grand scheme of things. At the end of the day then whilst it has a few shortcomings Steamroll delivers more fun moments than frustrating moments and the uniqueness when it comes to its puzzles means this game is a decent addition to the puzzle genre and in the end it does more than enough to get a recommendation from me. Thumbs up!"

I’ve played some classic Shmup’s over the years and whilst you can’t call Overdriven Reloaded: Special Edition a classic it’s still a decent addition to the genre. The most important thing about a game like this is to keep the gameplay fun and thankfully that’s exactly what they do. You can enjoy this game in both solo and co-op and when played in both these modes the game possesses a challenge but never seems to get frustrating, which is great. I was also very impressed with the controls that have been implemented in the game and they didn’t once fail me which is of course very important. There is a few levels to sink your teeth into and whilst some of them are good I did find a few of them to lack in variety and some of them did become a chore when they had to be replayed. In terms of content the game has more than enough for you to be getting on with and the game is definitely value for money. I will say though that some of the modes did feel a bit samey and the game is definitely best enjoyed in short bursts. One of the aspects of the game that didn’t lack in variety were the boss battles. I found the boss battles to be an incredibly enjoyable affair and each boss battle felt like it mattered so things remained exciting throughout when in these battles. The presentation side of the game is something that I was a big fan of. Visually the game has a nice look to it and each environment makes the game stand out quite considerably. The same can also be said about the sound design and the best thing is that I never once grew tired of the soundtrack. At the end of the day Overdriven Reloaded: Special Edition may not try to do anything different, but in the end it doesn’t need to because the tried and tested formula works well here. Don’t get me wrong the game is far from perfect and it does have a few shortcomings, but the most important thing is that it gets more right than it gets wrong. Without a doubt fans of the Shmup genre will find more than enough to keep them satisfied here and in the end it does enough to warrant a recommendation from me."

Action|Platformer|2D|,"Sep  8, 2020",E10+,Ignition Publishing,76,Ignition Publishing,OkunoKA Madness,tbd,"OkunoKA Madness is a platform game in which you play as KA, a blue hero who must save the world of souls from the evil hands of Os - his bitter enemy. You will have to jump, run and overcome obstacles through unique and colorful worlds with more than 100 levels, collide with bosses completely out of your mind, find hidden secrets, surprises to unlock and an even more difficult world: Madness. Okunoka Madness is a tough as nails platformer where you go through various stages trying to get from point A to point B. The basic gameplay is pretty simple and I am sure all gamers have played this sort of game once in their life. The first few stages of the game gives you a glimpse into the control scheme and the basic template and after those few levels, the difficulty spikes up venomously - you’ll understand the pun when you reach the stage. As you go through stages, you gain power ups such as one which allows you to control ice and you can use it to freeze and unfreeze specific platforms on command, similar for fire platforms later on. But don’t be fooled, everything that is given to you will be used against you in this game. Every powerup means there will be new and more difficult challenges which will require you to have extreme precision over your controls. Speaking of controls, I am extremely happy to report that the controls are super tight. I get frustrated normally in these games when the characters are a little extra slippery or when they don’t take inputs in between. No such case here, absolutely tight controls mean you’ll only have yourself to blame for the deaths and you’ll die a lot. But considering the length of each stage is on the shorter side, the deaths don’t feel as frustrating as they would if the stage size was larger. On a side note, this game seems to be custom built to be played by a controller. Due to some issues in lockdown, I did not have my controller when I previewed this game and that showed. While you can work with a keyboard, I recommend a controller for the best experience. I am sucker for colorful bright games and Okunoka Madness delivers that in loads. The stages are filled with colours, even the drabber levels are more colorful than most. The obstacles also are impeccably designed for being a visual treat and the creatures that loom in the background are fascinating to say the least. Even better designed are the bosses and the protagonist itself. Even the deaths are surprisingly beautiful, instead of dying gorily like you would in a game of this nature, your body disintegrates into little crystals and rejoin at the start point. This makes even death very pretty to look at. Such a surprisingly beautiful game that even though it is designed to frustrate, I couldn’t help but come back to it over and over again. The sound design of Okunoka Madness is very good, that is to say, it compliments very well the visuals and creates a sense of peace. There is such harmony in such a brutal game that you can’t help but appreciate the sound design even more. I’ll keep it short here, I recommend Okunoka Madness whole heartedly. If you have even the least interest in a game of the genre, you should check out Okunoka Madness when it releases. Impeccable level design, tight controls and some heartwarming visuals makes it one of the easiest recommends I can give for your Xbox One."

Despite feeling easy there's plenty of creativity in the puzzles and it never made me feel frustrated during my journey. Point-and-click adventures are great, Truberbrook even got my girlfriend to sit with me, and play along even in a 1 player affair we can share in the enjoyment. This along without overly complex problem solving we both felt at home because I often find games in this genre to contain a story that stays interesting from start to finish and Truberbrook definitely does contain a story that stays interesting throughout but this game does also feature a few setbacks along the way. Which may stop it from entering as the best games from within the genre will. Thankfully in the end it gets slightly more right than wrong and without a doubt something it gets extremely right is its art, and overall audio and visual presentation. This added immersiveness is a good save, because it helps offset a level of immersiveness that’s lost due to the game’s few issues we have already discussed. In terms of the gameplay this game features the usual point-and-click formula with plenty of fun and puzzles to solve during the story. Truberbrook isn’t a bad game, it's just priced relatively high for what is at it's core. The difficulty may have been intentionally left easier to appeal to a broader audience. What's here is worth plying especially if you're a fan of the genre. You may just want to wait on a sale to get in at a more competitive price point if this isn't your usual cup of tea."

Action|Platformer|2D|,"Mar 20, 2018",E10+,Square Enix,76,Demimonde,Octahedron,7.6,"There are a huge amount of puzzle platformers out there and whilst a lot of them are fun and enjoyable quite a few of them are pretty samey, which can lead them to become a little boring. Octahedron is a puzzle platformer that in a way breaks from the usual tradition and this without a doubt makes it one of the most enjoyable puzzle platformers I’ve ever played. Something that really impressed me about this game was the level design. Each level has had a lot of thought and effort put into it and this makes things stay fresh and interesting throughout. Platforming in these levels feels great and everything feels tight and fluid at all times and most important of all the fun factor stays high even when things get harder. The main reason why the fun factor never seems to dwindle is because they’ve got the perfect balance of being challenging and fair at the same time, so dying never seemed to frustrate me. I would however have liked to have had a few tutorials every now and then because not knowing what to do at the start can cause some unnecessary deaths, but the frustration levels remained low most of the time which is a bonus. Obviously a very important aspect in a game like this is how the controls handle, and thankfully they hold up really well. The controls are very simple to understand and they never get awkward so you don’t have to worry about doing anything complicated which in turn allows you to enjoy your journey through the levels to the max. In terms of content the game has enough to keep you going for a bit, but in my opinion there isn’t enough. Don’t get me wrong the content that is present has been done to perfection but once completed the game doesn’t give you much of a reason to return, so a few more modes would have given the game much more in terms of replayability. The presentation side of the game is awesome from start to finish. Visually the game has an abundance of neon colour and when you combine that with the groovy soundtrack you find yourself enjoying the levels even more, which is great. At the end of the day Octahedron is a game that I fully recommend to people who love a new and unique approach to a genre that hasn’t really had much uniqueness over the last few years. Each different mechanic plays a part in this game and when they combine together it’s a game that is not only fun but also very addictive as well, and for me it’s up there with the very best of puzzle platformers."

Action|Shooter|Shoot-'Em-Up|Top-Down|,"Jul 17, 2018",E,Nighthawk Interactive,75,Llamasoft,Tempest 4000,6.8,"Not many people haven’t experienced Tempest in some shape or form and that shows to me just how prominent Tempest has been in regards to the gaming industry. Year’s ago they took a simple idea and turned it into a very fun and addictive experience to be played by all and every now and then they release a new shiny version for you to get to grips with. The new version of the game is called Tempest 4000 and even though it has a few shortcomings to say once again I enjoyed my time with a new version of Tempest would be quite the understatement. Once again the gameplay is simple but very addictive and this easy to pick up and play style means gamers of all skill levels and ages can join in the fun, which is great. In terms of content the game will keep you satisfied for quite a while, but I would recommend that you wait till it drops in price a little because at the moment in my opinion it’s a little bit too expensive. Another reason why I would recommend for you to wait till it lowers in price is because there isn’t really anything new that veterans of the series won’t have seen before. That being said the content that is here has been done to perfection and it will provide you with plenty of enjoyable moments. You’ll pleased to know then that technically Tempest 4000 doesn’t suffer with any problems at all. The controls remain tight and responsive throughout your time with the game and everything else also plays out the same way which limits frustration quite a lot. This is a very good thing because the game does get very difficult quite quickly, but even though the game can be overly difficult at times I still didn’t find myself getting frustrated that much. Instead I found myself returning to the game time and time again and the addictive nature of the game is clear to see from the get go. Defeating enemies never seems to get dull and when you defeat a number of different enemies at the same time you always end up getting a very satisfying feeling. Without a doubt the most noticeable improvement over the original game’s is the presentation side of things. Tempest has never looked and sounded better and in a way the improved visuals and sound design do make the gameplay even more fun and immersive. At the end of the day if you’re a fan of the Tempest series then you will thoroughly enjoy what Tempest 4000 has to offer. It may not get everything right but what it does do is provide you with a fun and very addictive experience that never seems to dwindle throughout your time with the game."

Thankfully it was worth the wait because they have managed to get a lot of the important aspects spot on. The gameplay is super addictive and the fast and frantic action really does a great job of creating a fun and adrenaline-fuelled experience. I would however have liked the guns to pack more of a punch and a few more combat moves would have been a nice addition, but other than that they get everything else spot on when it comes to the gameplay. Mercenary Kings: Reloaded Edition is one of them rare games where it’s both fun playing on your own and in co-op, and there isn’t much in it but the co-op action just edges it for me. In terms of content the game has more than enough to keep you satisfied and each level is an absolute blast to play, so don’t expect to get bored anytime soon. I will say though that the enemies you face could have been a little more exciting and had more in terms of variety, but that doesn’t really become a problem until you get later on in the game. Something that really surprised me about the game was the amount of customisation you can do. I was really impressed that I could give my game a personal touch and by being able to do this things stay fresh for longer. The presentation side of the game ticks a lot of boxes for me. Visually the game has a real retro feel and look to it and the added modern touches work ever so well. The sound design is pretty good as well and they’ve done a good job of creating an action filled atmosphere. At the end of the day if like me you’ve been waiting for Mercenary Kings to come to the Xbox One then you will be very happy because it was worth the wait. This game is filled with action from to start to finish and the best thing is that the action has been done pretty much to perfection. The problems it has are very small and no more problems reveal themselves throughout, which is great and this allows you to focus solely on the addictive gameplay. Without a doubt Mercenary Kings: Reloaded Edition gets a big recommendation from me and I can see it being a game I revisit quite often."

You are a Lumini, a lost and ancient race, and you collect gems and bring radiance back to the world. The game is an intricate work of art, and each element by itself isn't much of anything special. The world design is spectacular, and every area paints a mood. The music is dynamic and shifts seamlessly from moment to moment, creating an ambiance over every moment. As you progress along you gain more Lumini, and the amount of them represents your ""Health"". As you gather them you will obtain Lumini of three different colors, Blue Lumini that moves faster, Red Lumini that are aggressive and can attack enemies, and Yellow that can obtain gems from a distance. I feel that the Yellow Lumini weren't given enough time to shine. they only felt useful later in the game, and only briefly. That didn't detract from how much awe I was in as the music would shift as I entered a new area, or came upon a danger. One mechanic I found fun and daunting was having to split my flock, to press multiple buttons, or to hold one down as I went to retrieve some gems. Combat felt unintuitive at first, but once I got a grip on moving and swooping in for a hit it made more sense, and I felt accomplished. This game stands in a field alone, emitting grace and beauty. Lumini is an experience I feel many gamers can enjoy, Zen and beauty, with a pinch of action."

Thankfully it lived up to its potential and as far as strategy RPG’s are concerned Regalia: Of Men and Monarchs is a very good addition to the genre. Something that really stood out for me in this game was its story. The story is charming and packed full of humour and the best thing is that it keeps you invested throughout your time with the game. This is a very good thing because there is a huge amount of content for you to get to grips with and the story makes the content even better which is impressive because the content that’s in the game is already very good. The main reason why the content is so good is because they’ve done a wonderful job of making each task you can undertake matter and the amount of variety each task has makes it both fun and enjoyable which ultimately means the game has a lot of replayability. You will however have to get used to some of the time limit tasks because they can be a little frustrating at times and a little bit more freedom would’ve been nice here, but this is only a small problem and you will get used to these tasks relatively quick. You can’t mention the tasks in the game without mentioning a very important aspect of a strategy RPG and that is the combat. The combat that’s in the game is awesome and everything about it feels solid and responsive throughout. It also rewards you greatly when in battle and this means if you die you don’t get too frustrated and you want to carry on immediately. You will however have to get used to the fiddly camera when in battle and the awkwardness of it can be a little annoying at times, but thankfully as you progress you tend to forget about this slight annoyance. One of my most favourite things about this game was without a doubt the presentation. Visually the game has a beautiful art style that captures your imagination and when you combine that with the excellent sound design and voice acting you end up having a very enjoyable and immersive experience. At the end of the day Regalia: Of Men and Monarchs takes all the good things an RPG offers you and delivers them to you in an almost flawless manner and this means if you’re a fan of these types of games then Regalia is an absolute must buy. I never once got bored with this game because it was fun from start to finish and in the end it’s a game that gets a very big recommendation from me."

Unfortunately there has been many decent beat ’em up’s in recent year’s, but thankfully Wulverblade has made me realise why I enjoy this specific genre so much. The gameplay is absolutely fantastic and it never gets dull, which is great. Everything about the combat works flawlessly and whilst the difficulty can be a problem at times it still didn’t stop me from jumping straight back into the game. Something that really impressed me with Wulverblade was the story it delivers. The story is a wonderful tale and it does a great job of keeping you hooked throughout, and a big part of that is down to the writing and the fantastic voice actors. In terms of content the game has more than enough to keep you occupied. There is also an abundance of unlockables for you to collect and collecting all of these gives the game quite a lot of replay value. An important thing in a game like this is the maps that are included, and thankfully they get this spot on. There are an array of maps for you to battle on and each map has a lot of variety going for it, so it was a pleasure trying each map out. The game doesn’t really suffer with many problems and my only real complaint is that the small technical issues can take away from the game’s charm, but thankfully these issues don’t happen very often. The presentation side of the game is absolutely perfect in my opinion. Visually the game has an art style that’s packed full of charm and they really do make the gameplay stand out. The sound design is also fantastic and the immersion levels due to the sound design can be off the charts at times. At the end of the day Wulverblade has brought back a lot of fond memories for me and it made me realise just how much I love this genre. They’ve done this by integrating each different mechanic perfectly and there really isn’t anything bad about the game, which is great. Fans of the beat ’em up style will fall in love with this immediately and with the amount of content the game offers you, you won’t be getting bored for quite a while and ultimately it gets a massive thumbs up from me."

Мы туда в принципе и попали, но моментально сообразили, что играть на уровне 45-55 при имеющемся 40-ом не представляется возможным, при этом основная карта Египта конечно же была вылизана под чистую и догнаться до необходимого скилла нормальной возможности не было, а умирать от первого же прикосновения вражеского юнита, при том что даже фатальные удары лишь сдували с них пылинки так себе удовольствие. Поэтому пришлось нам двинуть прежде на Синай и ознакомиться с The Hidden Ones, который недвусмысленно намекал разграничением 40-45лвл, что здесь играть нам будет очень даже комфортно и Фивы после нас встретят вполне себе дружелюбно. В первом DLC к Origins мы имеем небольшую карту Синайского полуострова и игрового процесса с полным его прохождением на часов 10-12. По сути кроме новой территории и весьма короткого сюжета мы больше ничего не получили, это всё тот же Origins с тем же геймплеем без каких-либо нововведений. Достаточно ли этого было лично для меня? Учитывая, что в Origins я играл уже давненько, а игра мне очень понравилась, то да было очень приятно вернуться в Египет во времена правления Клеопатры. Детализация внешнего мира как всегда на высоте и хотя Синай не радует нас пестротой красок, это всё равно живой и аутентичный мир. The Hidden Ones конечно очень короткое приложение и если оценивать его как отдельностоящий от всего причастного к Origins продукт, то юбики явно не доработали и поторопились с его выпуском, поскорее решив заработать на фанатах серии. Если же рассматривать как некий пролог к Фивам, то в общем с пивом потянет, то есть всё же для нормального погружения придётся взять и Проклятие фараонов, а тут, забегая вперёд, уже куда интереснее."

Action|General|Shooter|First-Person|Arcade|,"Jul 17, 2018",T,Sold Out,77,Grip Digital,Mothergunship,7.2,"A game that has the term “bullet hell” thrown into the mix always has my attention because sometimes all I want to do is go on a destructive frenzy. Mothergunship allows you to do that and then some, but much to my surprise this isn’t the only thing it allows you to do and instead it offers up a number of different and intricate things for you to do along the way. In fact in terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to be getting on with and when the multiplayer option gets implemented I can see this being a game that’s very difficult to put down. Replaybility isn’t a problem even now thanks to its procedural design so imagine the replaybility when the multiplayer aspect comes to the game.  The gameplay then features a number of different mechanics for you to get to grips with and I’m pleased to say that each different mechanic is pretty much spot on. You’ll also notice right from the get go how much variety the gameplay has and that’s especially the case when it comes to the missions in the game. Each mission is fresh and interesting throughout and the enemies you face on these missions all have a creative side to them so completing a mission always feels satisfying. Starting a new mission however will get on your nerves a little bit and that’s mainly down to the loading times. The loading times literally feel like they go on forever and to say I got slightly annoyed with waiting around would be a little bit of an understatement. Thankfully though these are the only frustrating moments I experienced during my time with the game and I’m pleased to say that everything is perfect on the technichal side of things. I’m also pleased to say that the gameplay has got the perfect balance of being fair and challenging at the same time and if you’re worried about jumping in the game straight away then there’s a more than adequate tutorial to help you along the way. The story will also ease you into proceedings as well and whilst it failed to keep me invested throughout it still has a few decent parts placed into it. The presentation side of the game was actually one of my favourite things about the game and I felt that was mainly down to the atmosphere and immersiveness both the visuals and sound design created. At the end of the day as far as shooters go Mothergunship is a very decent shooter to say the least. All of the most important aspects are spot on and because of this any shortcomings the game has are quickly forgotten and in the end Mothergunship gets a big thumbs up from me."

Adventure|General|,"Nov  6, 2018",T,Wales Interactive,77,D'Avekki Studios Limited,The Shapeshifting Detective,6.0,The story had me hooked from start to finish because it was interesting at all times and it made me always want to find out what happened next. Each character present in the story had a lot of depth to them and they all felt important which in turn made the story stand out even more. I was very impressed and in some ways surprised with the amount of replaybility the game had. The presentation side of the game ticks all of the right boxes because both the visuals and sound design create a very immersive experience. I really enjoyed being able to choose what dialogue options I wanted because it gave me a great sense of freedom and it made me become more attached to the game. In terms of the gameplay side of things there isn’t too much you can do which may be off-putting for some. If you don’t like these types of game’s then there isn’t anything new present here that will change your mind. The FMV genre seems to split opinions right down the middle and it’s either a genre you love or hate with a passion. I’m a fan of the genre and it’s nice to see that there has been a nice steady amount of game’s released in recent years. Some of them have been good and some of them have lacked in several areas but thankfully the new release called The Shapeshifting Detective is definitely one of the good ones. In fact it may very well be the best FMV I’ve played so far because it features an unforgettable story packed with character’s that are not only interesting but packed with depth as well. When it comes to the gameplay there isn’t a great deal available to you and if you’re not a fan of these types of game’s then there isn’t anything here that will change your mind. This is a shame because if you’re sitting on the fence with this genre then I urge you to make this game your first in this genre because you can tailor how you want the dialogue to go and this does give the game quite a bit of replaybility. At the end of the day then The Shapeshifting Detective is a masterpiece in parts and if you love a good story that hooks you throughout then you owe yourself to get this game.

Adventure|Text|,"Oct 27, 2020",None,Devolver Digital,79,No Code,Stories Untold,6.5,"Stories Untold is a compilation tape of four experimental adventures, including a remaster of the original episode “The House Abandon”.  We are about to dive in a game that received top ratings on all other platforms so Xbox fanatics get ready.. Stories Untold incorporates point-and-click mechanics and retro style backgrounds to summon back to that text-based era without feeling stale. The gameplay is easy to figure out, although younger players not used to the genre may find it awkward at first. Basically you spend much of the game looking at a monitor, whether an old television or a computer display. Puzzle-solving makes up a large portion of the game, particularly in the listening post. Here you have to periodically spin your chair around and refer to a microfilm to decode numerical messages picked up on a shortwave radio. The puzzles are cleverly designed, satisfying to solve, and complemented by a mysterious plot that’s full of surprises throughout. You’re always on edge, wondering what surreal thing Stories Untold will throw at you next. While Stories Untold is not a game for everyone, and it's short length and limited interaction make it appear more like Black Mirror's Bandersnatch than most titles. That comparison is not quite fair, because Stories Untold goes beyond what the player expects repeatedly. Each chapter evolves and reveals a new layer of thought. There are many ways to tell a story, but Stories Untold could only be told this way. Without exposing too much about the game I’d say for the price point and the fun to be exoerienced on your Xbox One, there’s no reason not to add this most satisfying game to your “Digital” library."

Role-Playing|Action RPG|,"May 15, 2018",E10+,Humble Bundle,79,Humble Bundle,Wizard of Legend,6.9,"No matter how many roguelike games I’ve played over the year’s I still get excited when a new game comes out into the mix and most of the time they provide me with hours upon hours of enjoyment. Thankfully the new release Wizard of Legend provided me with a lot of enjoyment and in some ways it feels unique compared to some of the other game’s in the genre. One of the main reason why it feels so unique is down to its story. If you’re a fan of these particular games you’ll know that not many of them have much in terms of a story but Wizard of Legend is different. The story that’s present in the game is actually pretty decent and the best thing is that it has a lot of interesting lore. Another thing that makes this game unique is that it has an abundance of variety in all areas. The spells you can use in the game are fantastic and are packed full of variety, and by them doing this it means getting in combat with the fantastic enemies never seems to get boring. In fact the gameplay on the whole doesn’t end up getting boring but you will have to deal with a very high difficulty curve throughout your time with the game. Despite it being challenging and rewarding at the same time I can see the difficulty being a problem for some. I must admit that the difficulty did cause me a few problems along the way, but it still didn’t stop me from returning to the game time and time again. Thankfully though despite the game’s high difficulty you have very good controls to help you out. The controls in the game remain tight and responsive throughout and this does help you quite considerably. Another thing that would’ve helped with the difficulty curve is knowing what you’re buying at the shop. Unfortunately when you come to purchase an item there isn’t really an explanation as to what it is or does so you don’t know what to really buy, which can be frustrating from time to time. In terms of the presentation side of things I don’t expect too much from game’s like this, but I must admit that I did like Wizard of Legend’s style. There is a lot of colour in the visuals which is rare in games like this and when you combine those visuals with the very good sound design you end up enjoying the gameplay even more, which is great. At the end of the day Wizard of Legend has everything which I like about this specific genre, and I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s one of my most favourite roguelike adventure game’s I’ve ever played. So without a doubt this game gets a massive recommendation from me and if you’re a fan of these types of game’s then this is a game you can’t miss out on."

Action Adventure|General|,"Oct 21, 2021",E10+,Hatinh Interactive,79,Monochrome Paris,Tandem: A Tale of Shadows,tbd,"Tandem: A Tale of Two Shadows provides a gothic setting with a creepy doll with a hunchback and a protagonist with an uncanny look. While the setting of the world is undeniably gripping, the short puzzle game never completes its gothic vibe. Perhaps this is because the story is a little shallow, a love and hate twist ending or that the characters are mix mash of sense At its heart, Tandem: A Tale of Two Shadows isn’t a story based game as it relies heavily on its puzzle design. The presentation of the world’s gothic paradise is represented well through puzzles. However as clever as the design can be at times, the puzzles are never that taxing (possibly dulled down for audiences of any age). The puzzles work under two perspectives. You play as Emma from an overhead perspective as she wanders through forests and abandoned buildings. But, she’s not able to progress the world of Tandem alone. Locked gates, mechanical spiders, and strateicaly placed buttons. That’s where Fenton comes in as an animated teddy bear who can manipulate the shadows and reach areas Emma can’t. Playing as Fenton also adds a platforming element to the game play, as the side-scroller perspective comes complete with some obstacles to leap over. The presentation of this perspective-swapping mechanic is quite seamless, but there are a few minor sensitivity issues on the play through I experienced. It’s easy to switch between Emma and Fenton, only requiring the press of a button, but the game’s lack of clarity can frustrate. Emma needs to manipulate the light to provide Fenton with ground to stand on. As Fenton is surrounded by shadows, he can stand on those shadows to progress. But, if he’s standing in the middle of a shadow, he freezes and is unable to move. There’s minor lack of polish here, as there are times where it seems like Fenton is just being a big baby. He has a tiny foot in the shadow, and he can’t move… I experienced a time where it didn’t even seem like Fenton was trapped. There are other aspects of the game that make the puzzles feel more tedious. Stealth mechanics are snuck into Tandem, as Emma must traverse her way around a variety of enemies. One world features killer mechanical spiders, while another features some sort of squid that lives in pipes filled with oil. There are times when Emma needs to sneak past these enemies and these are by far the worst aspects of Tandem‘s puzzles. A part of me wishes the puzzles had a bit more complexity to them. The puzzles never feel too simple, but the game doesn’t challenge you as much as it could. The difficulty of the game isn’t necessarily a problem, but there isn’t a particular portion of the game that really gets you thinking too hard. Whether or not that’s a good or bad thing depends entirely on your preference. At least the presentation of Tandem’s world is well-executed, and the ability to mix in the lighting within the game’s puzzles is quite clever. As stated, these are easily the most interesting parts of the game. When you have to manipulate the light, using carts or mirrors, is when the game shines, as you have to correctly set up its double perspective. This aspect of the game can easily break into monotony, but the game isn’t that long anyway, so it never overstays its welcome. Defunct merry-go-rounds are lined up against the walls and alongside gardens or brick buildings. Tandem: A Tale of Two Shadows narrative is far less engaging and while it does take an interesting turn it’s messy for the majority of the game but the game is well priced for it offering. Tandem: A Tale of Two Shadows is a solid puzzle title based on executed premise. The game doesn’t over stay its welcome with it’s approximately five hours of playtime. If this sounds like your cup of tea then I suggest heading over to the Xbox games digital store and give it a go today. I may have seemed a bit critical despite its offering, I just suggest going in with the affordable price point in mind and you should have a great time. The games shine could also be in it’s playability for gamers of all ages."

These cubes can be moved by the player, either carrying them bodily or using magnetism or gravity. They can also be placed on teleporting machines to warp them to another teleporter and help solve puzzles. Mechanics really come alive when combined in ingenious ways. For instance, magnetism can be used to repel or attract cubes, but repelling a cube that has previously “anti-gravitated” gives you a frictionless device that will retain inertia until it collides against something solid, like a wall (or your skull). It can even be used as a means of transport for the player to reach new places. Cubes can also be used to power up some devices, in order to operate doors and force fields. As the player progresses towards more complex puzzles, they will encounter other devices - magnetic plates, elevators, buttons or even drones capable of nullifying magnetic and gravitational fields as well as stealing cubes."

Racing|Simulation|Automobile|,"Oct  5, 2020",E,Milestone S.r.l,78,Milestone S.r.l,RIDE 4,5.3,"Ride 4 overall the game itself is quite solid. It's the little things that bother me as I have always found the Ride franchise to be the weakest in Milestone's catalog while still remaining strong overall. There are many motorcycles missing that were previously in Ride 2. Overall the bugs in the game are limited thanks to an early patch. What I do find somewhat strange is that while driving and you look at the motorcycle from the side, you see several rear tires offset one behind the other possibly to give a shadow effect? The seams of the gloves also glow excessively in neon green or yellow, which takes away from the realism. They just need to have a very slight yellow tinge. As far as the sound, you can tell from some sounds from which motorcycles they could be, but many of them just sound very generic in style. Unfortunately, I can also say something negative about the driving physics as in the other games in the franchise. While playing the highest simulation level, I can hardly crash some bikes in a high lean angle and full throttle, which is obviously unrealistic being in full on simulation. With ABS off and the wheels also hardly lock up. You can't crash a wheelie by giving too much throttle and you can’t brake too much when doing a stoppie either. The AI has definitely improved this time around, but it may be too realistic for some players, because you can easily make too many mistakes. In nearly every race the AI rams into you with a lot of speed. The Milestone signature rewind function also makes its way to Ride 4, no big surprise there so that's a plus for players who want to play in simulation without too much worry or frustration in the end. In general, it's fun to drive around with the motorcycles, especially because there are no real alternatives to the Ride franchise. Ride 4 like the rest of the franchise I feel are a bit over on the price of admission for the overall content of the game. For me, even as Ride is Milestone's weakest franchise as I mentioned earlier it's still a great game. I may have pointed out a lot of negatives but there are all the Ride positives in place as well for fans of the franchise. If you enjoy motorcycle games or Milestone's franchises in general you should defintely enjoy what Ride 4 has to offer you for your Xbox One and upcoming Xbox Series X library."

Прежде всего этот непонятный и провальный как по мне переход в 2,5D измерение, небольшой хронометраж игры, странная цветовая палитра картинки, а также не самая выдающаяся история, ещё и оборванная где-то посередине. Trine 3 мягко говоря не оправдал ожиданий и расстроил в большей степени. Четвёртая анонсированная часть в этом свете уже не выглядела чем-то, чего стоило ждать бессонными ночами, ибо продолжение экспериментов грозило и вовсе поставить крест на одной из знаковых франшиз нашего времени. Много ли вы знаете сочных современных платформеров, в которые можно поиграть вдвоём/втроём на одном диване и не пожалеть о потраченном времени? Первая часть была конечно сыровата, но идеи были очень интересные, вторая же развернулась во всей красе, и на сегодняшний день она является эталоном как всей серии Trine так и среди кооперативных диванных платформеров для большой компании. Trine 3, как мы уже с вами решили, была неудавшимся экспериментом, и вот четвертая глава приключений известной троицы на радость всем возвращается к тем самым мощным корням второй части. Игра получилась как и Trine 2 очень красочной, с контрастирующими разнообразными уровнями. Картинка в Trine 4 выглядит бесподобно, показалось лишь что художественное исполнение выглядит более академично и строже чем безбашенный взрыв красок в Trine 2. Новейшие приключения троицы стали чуть медленнее предыдущих творений Frozenbyte, ибо упор серьезный сделан в ней на головоломки, буквально с каждой сменой экрана нам предстоит поскрипеть мозгами: направить лучи хитрым образом, выстроив правильную последовательность отражающих поверхностей дабы открыть проход, или те же манипуляции, но только с водой чтобы пробудить растение и создание прочих мудреные и действительно занимательных алгоритмов. Для решения этих самых задач наших героев наделили новыми достаточно любопытными возможностями и механиками. Их немного, но они весьма дельные, а некоторые из них помимо своей практичности наводят развеселого хаоса — речь конечно же о прыгающих шарах Амадея, как-то неоднозначно звучит))) Сюжет... нуууу такой пресноватый получился, сделаем скидку на то что это сказка, хотя те же финны в предыдущих историях троицы, за исключением третьей части, интригу нагоняли будь здоров. В этот раз так себе, если честно. Не понравилось также однотипность и блеклость противостоящих нам мобов, им явно не хватило индивидуальности да и просто узнаваемости. Сейчас спроси у меня кто портил кровь нашим персонажам, едва ли вспомню."

You can even run a whole level on a single combo if you're fast enough. With a ton of weapons, and enemies the game is a non-stop action fest. Being a Rouge-Lite it's surprisingly forgiving in what you lose on death, but every time you die, you get stronger, and off to the pages of the comic once more. You will be in a constant state of Die and Retry, but this only furthers what you're capable of. The soundtrack is perfect for the mood and keeps the pace rolling. The graphics are creamy smooth, even in the most intense times. The controls are super responsive lending way to very satisfying gameplay. There is an easy mode, that's customizable, allowing you to tone down the game, great for new players. One of the most intense Run-And-Gun games I've played in a long time.

Action|Platformer|2D|,"Apr  3, 2018",E10+,Armor Games,80,Massive Monster,The Adventure Pals,7.2,"I love games that allow you to have enjoyable moments as a family and in my opinion there isn’t enough of these types of games. The Adventure Pals is a game that people of all ages can enjoy and whilst it suffers with a few shortcomings me and my children still had a lot of fun with it, which is obviously what you want from a game. There are a few levels for you to get to grips with and I must admit that I was very impressed with the level design because each level is packed with a great deal of variety. I would however have liked a bit more content because there isn’t a vast amount for you to get to grips with, but thankfully the content that is here is very enjoyable. There are a few different elements in play at the same time and most of them hold up really well. The combat is something that I especially enjoyed and the simplicity of it means that you never get frustrated which is great considering if you die you have to start from the beginning of the level again. Thankfully I didn’t die that often but when I did die it was a bit of a nuisance returning back to the start of the level again. I will say though that dying is completely your fault and not the game’s fault because the game doesn’t suffer with any technichal issues and the controls that have been implemented remain tight and responsive throughout, which is great. I would however have liked the platforming side of the game to have had a bit more work put into it because jumping and traversing can feel a little floaty and awkward which can be a bit off-putting at times. If you like silly stories then The Adventure Pals will definitely put a smile on your face. It without a doubt made me and my children laugh out loud a few times and this made us to be able to connect with the characters quite a lot. The presentation side of the game also made us connect with the characters as well and that was mainly down to how much charm the visuals and sound design had and without a doubt the colourful visuals and nice sound design add to your overall experience and in some ways they make the gameplay even more fun. At the end of the day The Adventure Pals is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed and they definitely got more right than they got wrong. It may not be the best game of its type I’ve played but it does what it sets out to do and that is create a fun and enjoyable experience for the whole family and for that reason it gets a thumbs up from me."

The original fibbage was limited and was something my friends and I chewed through after ~30 game sessions split into 2/3 nights.  Knowing that there is at least twice the question content makes me feel better about having this second party pack, and the new games have their moments as well.  The biggest oddity to these party packs is, why bother releasing a new game when you can release expansions?  Fibbage is a sure-thing for a party with up to 8 players going at it simultaneously, BS'ing each other.  That's what makes the game so addicting.  Instead of ""hundreds"" of questions (the advertising on the website claims ~500 questions in Fibbage 2), Fibbage needs at least double that to really have staying power, and while fact-finding for these questions can consume time, I'm certain there's more than enough source material to get the question content up to that level.  At that point, questions you've seen the answers to will be so far & few between that you may not remember the answer, making for a much longer enjoyment period.  Quiplash XL seems to be the other strong contender here, but the other games that have some appeal don't quite have the immediate fun-factor.  Instead of tossing in 5 games, offering 2-3 high quality, highly replayable games makes more sense.

As you can imagine then I was really excited to learn that it was coming to the Xbox One and after sinking quite a few hours into it I can see why quite a lot of people love the game so much. This version that’s made it’s way to the Xbox One is the Superslime Edition and to say there’s a lot of content available to you would be a massive understatement. Having lots of content isn’t always a good thing though but it is here because each little piece of content has lots of variety and it kept me satisfied for ages. Whilst there is an abundance of content to get to grips with the most important aspect of this game is its 2D platforming elements. The platforming in this game is an absolute pleasure to play and became very addictive to its charming style really quickly. Obviously the platforming needs good controls to accompany it and thankfully the controls are perfect. Everything about the controls remain fluid and responsive throughout your time with the game and I didn’t suffer with any problems at all. You will however have to get used to the controls at first though because they can feel a little complicated at the start, but thankfully this is only a small problem and it doesn’t take you very long to get used to them. Something that some people may not get used to is the challenging nature of the game. If you’re a person who gets easily annoyed and lack when it comes to having quite a bit of patience then this game won’t be really enjoyable for you because it can get very challenging. Thankfully I was able to enjoy this game despite its tough difficulty curve and if you ride out the difficult moments you will be very pleased because the amount of variety that’s dotted throughout the game is absolutely brilliant and this means Slime-san stays fresh and interesting for a very long time. Something else that stays fresh and interesting for a very long time is also the presentation side of the game. Visually the game has a very old-school and retro vibe to it and when combined with the excellent sound design they do end up enhancing the gameplay and at the same time they make the game even more fun as well. At the end of the day Slime-san: Superslime Edition is an excellent addition to the 2D platforming genre. It has a lot of wacky and fun stuff throughout and each bit of content that’s included will deliver a fun and enjoyable experience to you for a very long time to come."

Strategy|Turn-Based|Card Battle|,"Mar 24, 2020",T,Konami,79,Konami,Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution,6.8,"Yu-Gi-Oh: Legacy of the Duelist Links Evolution - The classic anime card game returns with this installment. Gameplay wise Links Evolution offers up a vast amount of content for players that fans of the series will gobble up happily. Taking part in Online Multiplayer mode and competing in duels that follow tournament rules will offer countless hours of gameplay alone. Coming to the Single Player modes, you are offered up several modes to take part in, Campaign mode firstly where you can relive all the card dueling action from the Iconic 1st series right through to VRAINS. As you battle through you will unlock characters that can be used in the Dueling mode in Single Player, along with Decks and Cards. Using the battle points gained from dueling you can also purchace various things to boost your custom built or premade decks!  Featuring a massive 10,000+ cards there is a huge amount of variety and no deck will ever be truly the same. While some moments of the campaign mode can be very annoying and you are outmatched massively within just a couple of turns (EG: Weevil gets basically gets his Ultimate moth summoned within 1st turn) You can be left feeling utterly hopeless before you can even take a turn and watch on hopelessly as they destroy any monster you summon and drain your lifepoints within a few turns OR you admit defeat and just surrender, HOWEVER believe in the heart of the cards and you will pull through those moments after a few attempts. The visuals are nice, however I honestly felt that it could have done with a boost, feeling slightly dated, however given that this game is pretty much just an updated version of Legacy of the Duelist I suppose a visual update may have been out of the question, and in my opinion the game suffers for it. The controls are very nice and easy to use. Nothing complex here as that is left to the dueling stratagies both employing and countering.  There is a few issues out of the box like the constant prompts each turn if you have a trap / spell card that can be used however these can be skipped by holding the B button or disabled and manual activation of card effects turned on in the settings. Overall: For fans of the Yu-Gi-Oh series I would highly recommend this game to as to relive the action of all the series in a single game. For fans of card games this is a possible good addition for you and does offer a nice story line to follow to boot. As a standalone game it could have used some updates to make it feel and look more current but it doesn't deter from the game and is still a good solid game."
Action|Action Adventure|General|,"Aug  7, 2018",T,Zoink!,79,Zoink!,Flipping Death,6.3,"The hint system might be a good idea for some I found it made the game way too easy because instead of giving you an hint it basically tells you what to do. Most of the puzzles in the game fail to pack a punch and I would’ve liked to have seen a little more in terms of variety here. Does Flipping Death do enough to get a recommendation from me. Zoink Games have delivered quite a few memorable experiences and as far as developers go they’re definitely one of my favourites. As you can imagine then I was very excited to get to grips with Flipping Death and thankfully it didn’t disappoint. In fact Flipping Death could be the best game that Zoink Games has done so far, which is no small feat considering the amount of successes they have under their belt. Without a doubt this game does more than enough to get a recommendation from me because it has a lot of charm dotted in a number of areas and when the game is in full flow both the story and gameplay are excellent."

With the RPG element and the story can branch in many different directions depending on your choice. The replay value in this game is extremely high. I find myself playing this over and over just to see different conversations and different arks on the story. The story also pulls you in right from the start and with the different types of characters i found myself relating and caring for each in there own way. This is a developer i will be watching to see what great works they release in the future.

Miscellaneous|Compilation|,"Oct 31, 2017",E10+,Abstraction Games,79,Abstraction Games,8-Bit Adventure Anthology: Volume One,tbd,"I love when these classic games are brought back to life, and when done correctly they deliver a number of nostalgic moments. Thankfully 8-Bit Adventure Anthology: Volume One has been done correctly and each different game that’s been ported plays just like the original so there’s buckets of nostalgia present throughout. I forgot how good the stories were in game’s like this and it’s a nice pleasant reminder because each story is interesting and keeps you hooked throughout. The puzzles in the game have aged really well and if you love puzzles that offer you a challenge and require some thought then you will love this anthology. I will say though that the cursor in the game can be frustrating when trying to complete the puzzles, and that’s mainly down to how slow it moves and in my opinion they could have provided you with an option of speeding the cursor up. They have maintained each game as close to the original as they can and in my opinion this will put some gamers off, and a few slight tweaks here and there would have definitely made the game more accessible to different gamers. I will say though that they’ve got the price spot on and it doesn’t cost you a lot to take a trip down memory lane, which is great. The presentation side of the game is perfect and I’m glad they never changed anything here. Visually the 8-Bit art style has never looked better and the accompanying sound design stirs up a lot of fond memories, which is awesome. At the end of the day from the moment it was first announced I must say that I was looking forward to it, and thankfully it delivered on my expectations I had for the game. Fans of the original game’s will once again fall in love with them, and the nostalgic feel of the game will put you right back to when you first played the titles on offer. If you don’t like old-school games that have had no changes delivered to them then you won’t find much enjoyment here, but it gave me a lot of enjoyment and it gets a big recommendation from me."
Action|Platformer|2D|,"Jul 11, 2018",E10+,Fire Hose Games,79,Batterystaple Games,20XX,8.0,"A video game that even slightly resembles the Mega Man series has my interest and full attention because it’s a series that has delivered me so much joy over the year’s and at the end of the day as far as platformers go it’s up there with the very best. 20XX has been on the PC for some time now and from the moment I first saw it I was very eager to get to grips with it. Thankfully its finally made its way to the Xbox One and even though it has a few imperfections to say I enjoyed my time with the game would be a massive understatement. Obviously if you’re trying to capture the true feel of a game like Mega Man then you have to have very good platforming elements, and thankfully I’m pleased to say that they’ve got this aspect of the game spot on. By getting this important aspect right it means the gameplay ends up being an incredible amount of fun and that’s exactly what 20XX delivers to you. In fact the game was that fun that I quickly forgot about the game’s high difficulty curve and that’s impressive because at times the game’s difficulty can cause you a few frustrating moments here and there. As I said though I was easily able to look past this and I’m glad I did because in terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to be getting on with and the best thing is that the content has a lot of variety thanks to the inclusion of the procedural engine. Despite it having a lot of variety in most areas it would’ve been nice to have seen a little more variety when it came to the enemies you face though because facing the same type of enemies can become a little tedious every now and then. Thankfully though defeating them didn’t become tedious and that was mainly down to there being a huge amount of upgrades for you to sink your teeth into and the best thing is that each upgrade actually felt different, which is great. Without a doubt one of my favourite things about this game was its presentation. Visually the game has managed to implement a retro look whilst also having a modern feel to it as well. The sound design also offers you a retro and modern vibe at the same time as well and when both the visuals and sound design combine together the gameplay becomes even more fun. At the end of the day if you like platformers with a Mega Man feel then you will thoroughly enjoy what 20XX has to offer. I really enjoyed my time with the game and if a little bit of a story was included then I probably would’ve enjoyed the game even more. That being said at the end of the day 20XX does more than enough to get a thumbs up from me."

Sports|Team|Futuristic|,"May 10, 2018",E10+,505 Games,81,roll7,Laser League,7.3,"Laser League is a game that I’ve heard a lot of good things about and because of that I played for a few hours a couple of months ago on my friends PC and to say I enjoyed it would be a massive understatement. As you can imagine I was thrilled to learn it was coming to the Xbox One and thankfully it’s a game I can see me playing for a very long time. Without a doubt this game is super addictive and the amount of replayability on this game is almost endless, and the best thing is that it never seems to get boring. The reason it doesn’t get boring is because every match you play is completely different and it keeps on surprising you, which is great. Everybody can enjoy this game because they’ve made the gameplay very simple to understand and the featured easy to pick up and play style doesn’t have any flaws. This is mainly down to the fantastic controls that have been implemented. Everything about the controls remained tight and responsive throughout and they keep everything simple yet very effective. You may have noticed that I’ve used the word simple quite a few times, but don’t worry because the game will definitely provide you with a challenge as well. I suspect you would expect the challenging moments to be frustrating then, but that couldn’t be more wrong because not once did I become frustrated and instead it just remained fun and enjoyable at all times. It’s especially fun when played with friends and the game definitely rewards you working together as a team. The teamwork in the game is absolutely brilliant and to top it off there are a number of different moves and classes for you to try out. I was especially impressed with the classes in the game because each one has a lot of variety and this keeps things fresh throughout. In terms of gripes I don’t really have too many. I would’ve liked a few more maps and I would’ve liked the maps to have a little more variety, but I was easily able to look past this due to the fantastic gameplay. I would’ve also liked a little more variety when it came to the presentation side of the game as well, but they don’t do anything seriously wrong here. The visuals and sound design are not bad it’s just that they can become a little boring after a while. At the end of the day Laser League is an absolutely brilliant game and I’m very excited to see how the game evolves over the coming months. I haven’t been this excited about a game of this ilk since Rocket League and with more content and a little bit more work I can see this being as big as Rocket League. Trust me this game is an absolute must buy."

Racing|Simulation|Automobile|,"Sep  4, 2020",E,Nacon,83,KT Racing,WRC 9 FIA World Rally Championship,4.6,"WRC 9 is yet the next installment in my long time enjoyable rally series. Let's make one thing clear, this isn't a leap forward in the same sense that WRC 8 was however the net generation is right around the corner and it will be interesting to see what enhancements await with games like dirt 6 Irving soon.. The racing in WRC 9 is surely fantastic. It's still accessible enough that people of all ages can set up and enjoy they game at their desired skill set. It manages this through its improved physics, and just the general feel of the cars handling, as well as how they react to the varying challenges the game brings your way. Fortunately, KT Racing seems to have finally fixed a long-running issue where, even after the slightest of bumps, my car would go flying off like the wright brothers on an early flight attempt. I'm not going to say the car sticks to the road, you'll get some air when needed as this is a rally game after all, but all this is part of the racing and your car responding to the track is a great improvement. About responding to the track, you'll find the game offers great reactions to different surface types and weather conditions. From dirt to gravel, a dry surface, to a soaked surface, or snow, you'll find it genuinely feels different with a change of course or a change of car. When it comes to the awe striking weather effects in WRC 9. You'll find it a lot more challenging and a struggle to stay on course and not find yourself wrapped around the scenery as frequently. Well, you may find yourself wrapping yourself around a surprising obstacle every now and then, particularly when you find a tree for example that's just chilling in the middle of the course? One thorn still there and if I've complained, you're allowed to go a bit off track and if you crash, the game needs to give you more time to recover. By the time I'm recovering myself the game is transporting me back on the track with a stern look on its face and a sharp penalty to my time. WRC 9 is a genuinely beautiful game. From the great shots of light filtering through the lush trees, to the impossibly dark extreme weather events you can find in the campaign. If you turn your lights off, all you can hear is the thunder of the torrential rain on your roof and the crash as you hit the wall you couldn't see after spinning out after aquaplaning. The only issue you may find is if you look too closely at the spectators or some backgrounds, the same quality isn't always apparent. However, you're not meant to be focusing on them, you're meant to be zipping past at 200 miles per hour to the winners cup. At least that's how the engines sound, well, if you're going that fast. The audio is on the same level as the visuals. WRC 9 is yet another step ahead for the WRC series from previous installments. However, unlike last year's outing which was a massive leap, this seems to be content to simply refine. In keeping with that the visuals , audio, general racing improvement, as well as improved physics. There are a few bugs but nothing game breaking in the least. There's no doubt that WRC 9 is a strong contender and should certainly be on the list for anybody who wants a great rally game for their Xbox One and Xbox Series S/X in a few months time."

The art is top notch, and there is a wide variety of interesting characters and creatures. Don't let the 'pinball' part scare you if you don't like pinball games... honestly, the pinball aspect is very low key. You do need a basic knowledge of pinball, such as rotating targets and ball behavior to bumper hits, but to me it seems secondary to the main game... you'll easily figure out what to do and the game is very forgiving for the pinball areas. The game has great exploration and the execution is perfect. It's a giant island, but every 'level' within that island is well thought out and a pleasure to traverse. Highly recommended!"

Action Adventure|General|,"Apr 10, 2018",E10+,Soedesco,83,BlitWorks,Owlboy,6.3,"Owlboy is a game I’ve heard many good things about and to say I was looking forward to playing it on the Xbox One would be a massive understatement. Thankfully the game was worth the wait and in my opinion it’s one of the best 2D adventures I’ve ever played which is no small feat because there have been many 2D adventures I’ve enjoyed over the years. If you love games with charming stories then Owlboy does more than enough to satisfy that urge. The story is both fun and interesting throughout and in the end you get really attached to the characters that are present in the story. The characters on the whole are wonderful and you can tell that a lot of thought and effort has gone into them because each character feels important and plays an important part throughout your time with the game. The gameplay that accompanies the fantastic story and characters has been done to perfection. Everything about the gameplay feels tight and responsive and each different mechanic has been done that well that it adds something different to the gameplay. I was also very impressed with the level design in the game and the amount of variety that’s present in each level makes exploring a very fun and enjoyable experience. There is also a number of different puzzles for you to get to grips with in the different levels and thankfully the clever design of these puzzles meant that I hardly ever got frustrated, which is a bonus. I must admit that I was surprised by how much content the game has and it will keep you satisfied for a number of hours and the best thing is that you never seem to get bored throughout your time with the game. Unfortunately though once you complete the game you’re highly unlikely to return back to it and that’s a shame because the content that’s on offer is absolutely amazing. The presentation that accompanies the fantastic content is also amazing and I loved everything about this aspect of the game. Visually the game can look really beautiful at times and when you combine that with the very charming sound design it ends up bringing the gameplay and story alive at every turn. At the end of the day Owlboy is one of them rare games where I don’t really have a gripe with anything that they offer up and I must admit that Owlboy is one of the most enjoyable game’s I’ve played so far this year. In fact as far as the 2D adventure genre goes it may very well be my most favourite game I’ve ever played in the genre and to say that’s an impressive feat would be a massive understatement to say the least. Without a doubt Owlboy gets a massive recommendation from me and if you’re a fan of this specific genre then the game is an absolute must buy."

Action|Shooter|First-Person|Arcade|,"Dec 19, 2019",M,Gearbox Publishing,82,Gearbox Software,Borderlands 3: Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot,6.9,"Так как подача материала в Borderlands 3 в диалогах отличается своей неукротимой стремительностью, то к сожалению не всегда успеваешь уловить смысл происходящего. Если в третьей Борде, благодаря большому количеству катсцен и скоростному чтению текстов по диагонали, всё же удавалось не потерять смысловую нагрузку, то вот в первом полноценном дополнении Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot ускользать стало значительно больше и дело не только в том что трещать стали больше и активнее, но и в качестве перевода и возможно багах, из-за которых периодически субтитры и вовсе не появлялись. Определенно игра от меня никогда не получит высший балл с такой подачей материала пока не будет полной отечественной локализации, ибо потеря картинки в процессе чтения сабов или сабов в процессе движухи на экране очень сильно расстраивает и периодически сильно раздаржает. Борда не позиционирует себя как тупой шутер, она очень сильно хочет насытить пространство информацией, придать смысл происходящему, поюморить в конце концов, а нам не носителям языка врубиться во все тонкости к сожалению не так-то и просто. Ладно, это я о наболевшем... В итоге история по новому заданию от Мокси у нас как-то в цельный пазл сложилась не очень-то, пришлось что-то дочитывать по прочим обзорам, а этого быть однозначно не должно. Всё же давайте ближе к телу… В первом DLC попадаем мы в заброшенное казино, принадлежавшее ныне почившему антогонисту предыдущей части Красавчику Джеку. Мокси на правах бывшей подружки Красавчика и человека участвовавшего в проектировании казино и оставшаяся в итоге ни с чем, решила в текущих обстоятельствах заполучить богатства огромной космической станции практически дрейфующего в космосе Лас Вегаса. Ну и конечно делать за Мокси всё будем мы, кто бы сомневался, при незначительном участии и по большей части наставлении со стороны нескольких забавных фриковатых ее сотоварищей, с которыми по ходу путешествия по локациям казино мы будем знакомиться. Как всегда персонажи в Борде это здоровый юмор, харизма и колорит. Вопросов нет тут как всегда постарались на отлично. Казино, как ожидалось не совсем заброшено и своры головорезов и многочисленная роботизированная сбрендившая охрана препятствуют нам в наших помыслах всеми мыслимыми и немыслимыми способами. Карта летающего казино достаточно большая и многоуровневая, хотя вот так чтобы броских изменений в интерьере в процессе прохождения замечено особо не было.

While Final Fantasy X-2 is a direct sequel it is set by a much lighter story in a freshly liberated Spira where you instead take on the role of Yuna. While it’s a very different game with a revamped combat system at your disposal, X-2 features a turn based combat system that runs in a ""real-time"" manner although you have the ability to slow the real time clock. Instead of seven characters, you control only three this time around. Customization instead comes in the form of ""dresspheres"", which are essentially 20 different classes you can swap amongst on the fly. You build loadouts of ""dresspheres"" using a system referred to as the garment grid, which offers plenty of flexibility during battle as long as you’ve planned accordingly for the variety of scenarios. Timing it right allows you to chain attacks for higher damage as well. Both are excellent remasters and well executed for the Xbox One. This collection will keep any Square Enix fan busy reliving the epic journeys at hand or enjoying them for the first time in their remastered glory. The price of admission is a little high however for these remasters compared to the other recent remasters made for Xbox fans, however as we have seen in the past Square is always good at offering sales on their games to allow for everyone to eventually add these little gems to their Xbox gaming libraries. If you're a true Final Fantasy fanatic you won't want to wait for a sale, other enjoy them for what are possibly the best remasters I've yet to play on the Xbox console."

Визуально сразу обращаем внимание, что основная карта по сравнению с Синаем увеличилась вдвое, а учитывая некоторую особенность игры, которую сразу и не приметить, мы получаем в три раза больше территорий для обследования и часов 18 полного игрового времени. Но что это за территории! Это просто какой-то океан красок и смены настроений. Честное слово, не видел ничего подобного! В этот раз дизайнеры уровней отработали свой хлеб на сто процентов, да и, пожалуй, действительно смогли прыгнуть выше головы. И речь ведь не только о самих Фивах, когда настанет очередь постичь ту самую особенность игры - 4 загробных мира, то у вас просто отвалится челюсть. Хоровое синхронное «Вау!» у нас с женой повторялось практически с каждым попаданием в новый загробный мир. Это действительно что-то невообразимое, невероятный полёт фантазии, и тут уже и сюжет и некая вторичность геймплея всё это уже кажется не так важно. Просто хочется побродить и покрутить головой во все стороны ибо тут однозначно есть на что посмотреть. Коротко о не самом главном в этой части: 1) история Проклятия Фараонов вышла какой-то мутноватой, хотя впрочем, как мне кажется, это уже давняя проблема Assassin’s Creed в целом. Пожалуй, со времён Эцио не появлялось по настоящему интригующего и мощного сюжета; 2) по геймплею ничего нового мы не увидим, разве что подкинули ещё красивого и внушительного оружия, которое в общем-то всё равно базово делится на несколько видов ещё со времён главной Origins; 3) в виду того что мы попадаем в загробный мир, то у нас появляются и новые враги это шакалоголовые слуги Анубиса разных достоинств в том числе и доселе невиданные лекари, способные поднять павших воинов, а также огромные скорпионы. Когда юбики найдут толкового автора для своих действительно грандиозных работ AC будет безоговорочным лидером жанра, а пока это ну почти шедевр за счёт невероятно насыщенного и удивительного игрового мира и увлекательных дополнительных квестов."

Strategy|Action Adventure|Management|Survival|Government|,"Oct 11, 2019",M,11 bit studios,84,11 bit studios,Frostpunk: Console Edition,8.2,"Я не очень понимаю почему так мало стратегий в реальном времени или градостроительных симуляторов, как вам угодно, адаптировано на консолях? Неужели так сложно довести до ума и дать любителям массовых застроек насладиться этим прекрасным жанром, управляя процессами джойстиком, а не клавиатурой с мышью? Вот поляки из 11 bit studios, как по мне, прекрасно справились с задачей переноса своего детища на приставки текущего поколения. Итак, о Frostpunk поподробнее. Наша главная миссия в игре выжить в условиях суровых морозов. Существуем мы в альтернативной реальности в 1886 году где солнце постепенно затухает и мир погружается в вечную зиму. Вокруг сердца города - огромного генератора, работающего на угле и соответственно согревающего людей и дающего тепло и энергию всем постройкам, возводим город. Видов ресурсов у нас немного - это уголь, древесина, сталь, сырая еда, пищевые пайки и паровые ядра. Главные для выживания ресурсы это конечно уголь для поддержания необходимого тепла и пищевые пайки, которые изготавливаются из сырой пищи, для того, чтобы наши горожане были всегда сыты. Прочие ресурсы необходимы для строительства всевозможных зданий, изучения новшеств и экспедиций. Помимо всего прочего необходимо следить за шкалой недовольства и надежды, каждая из них очень важна, так как в случае накопившегося недовольства или полностью угасшей надежды нас незамедлительно выставляют на мороз, после чего все придётся начинать сначала. Воздействуем на наших жителей прежде всего за счёт удовлетворения текущих нужд и принятия законов. Очень рекомендую начать играть для начала в бесконечном режиме, который не так суров к игроку и дает возможность понять все нюансы, ибо сюжетная часть весьма беспощадна и не терпит ошибок, исправить их будет очень сложно. В Frostpunk присутствуют четыре сценария: Новый дом - основная большая сюжетная ветка, Ковчеги, Беженцы и Падение Винтерхоума. Каждая история ставит перед нами свои задачи и в общем и целом они достаточно разные. Если в Новом доме мы с нуля отстраиваем город и готовимся к грандиозной буре, которую соответственно надо пережить. Хотя надо ещё до этой самой бури дожить, а это, скажу я вам, весьма и весьма непросто в виду постоянно валящихся проблем, с которыми едва успеваешь справляться как на очереди их уже вдвое больше. В кампании Ковчеги, к слову, самой миролюбивой к игроку, кажется это единственная кампания, где у меня никто не умер, нам необходимо поддерживать определенную температуру в трёх оранжереях, где хранятся чуть ли не последние на земле растения и семена. Это великолепный градостроительный симулятор со своей тяжелой и захватывающей историей. Бесповоротные рекомендации для тех кто понимает."

Action|General|,"Jul 19, 2018",None,Messhof,84,Messhof,Nidhogg 2,tbd,"I only played Nidhogg briefly back in 2014 and despite me only playing the game for a brief amount of time I really enjoyed what the gameplay had to offer. In a way the gameplay was unique and it stood out quite a bit which meant returning to the game was quite easy to do. As you can imagine then I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on Nidhogg 2 and I was very excited that it was finally making its way to the Xbox One. Thankfully it was worth the wait and I’ve already sunk quite a few hours into the game and the best thing is that I can’t see myself getting bored of Nidhogg 2 any time soon. Once again the gameplay is a very unique experience and when you factor in the very good strategy elements as well you do end up getting addicted quite quickly. Even though the replaybility and addictiveness is quite high in the game I would still recommend that you play this game in short bursts because it does become repetetive quite quickly. I will say though that it only really became tedious and repetetive when playing on your own and without a doubt the best way to enjoy this game is when you play with friends. Playing it this way is much more fun and you’ll find that you end up sinking a huge amount of hours into the game without realising when you play in co-op. One thing that really impressed me about this game was the amount of customisation the game delivers to you. You can literally chop and change every little detail to your heart’s content and by doing this it means that you can make every game completely different, which is great. Despite there being a huge amount of customisation available to you it doesn’t really have anything different from the first game, but whilst this may be off-putting for some it didn’t really bother me that much. Technically once again the game holds up really well throughout and there isn’t really any problems to discuss. This is great then because no issues mean the frustration levels never get high at all and this gives you another reason to return back to the game time and time again. The presentation side of the game may not be the best you’ve ever seen before, but I actually really enjoyed it. Both the visuals and sound design have a unique flavour implemented into them and in a way this unique flavour makes the gameplay that little bit more fun. At the end of the day if you were a fan of the first game then you’ll love Nidhogg 2. It doesn’t do anything spectacularly different compared to the original but what it does do is take what was so good about the first game and in a way improve it a little bit and when it’s all said and done it does more than enough to get a recommendation from me."
Adventure|General|Point-and-Click|,"Sep 17, 2020",M,Triple Topping Games,84,Triple Topping Games,Welcome to Elk,tbd,"Welcome To Elk is a fascinating, small-scale narrative with meta elements coming from Denmark developer Triple Topping, Welcome to Elk is a bright spot in 2020. This 2D indie introduces main character Frigg as she’s arriving on Elk Island to apprentice in a woodshop for the summer. Once there, she’s soon introduced to the residents and becomes enmeshed in close-knit, small-town life. Welcome to Elk is a big bag of things, though it’s primarily a story about storytelling. It’s about how we take the bag of stories we’ve accumulated in our lifetime and use them as a material, like clay, to shape into things that help us survive. It's almost like a demo built around a second-hand story that was itself second-hand. So many layers of memory and interpretation in there, so much fuzziness and imprecision it's brilliant. The stark parts of the story get even more so and everything else gets vaguer. It's funny and horrible and genuinely dark while Welcome To Elk remains memorable too. This is such an easy game to recommend to all gamers, without spoiling it you will either like it or love it - I'm quite confident in the fact there's something here for nearly everyone to enjoy on their Xbox One."

Action|Action Adventure|Platformer|Linear|2D|,"Apr  2, 2019",E,Okomotive,84,Okomotive,FAR: Lone Sails,5.9,"In Far: Lone Sails, the puzzles aren’t really challenging but I found the game very unique and fun in it's own way. Unique experiences don't come around frequently enough anymore and FarL Lone Sails was able to deliver a fun although short experience I won't soon forget. A game doesn’t need to have any dialogue tell a dramatic story, but in order for a game to be successful when trying this concept it does need to be crammed with atmosphere and immersion. FAR: Lone Sails achieves this formula well, and both the visuals and sound design shine through an unforgettable journey with a few different emotions encountered along the journey.. Despite a small morsel of repetitiveness feeling occasionally,  I still enjoyed the game and the relaxing yet emotional tale. I would however have liked to have seen more puzzles or multiple paths that could have been taken, maybe we will get that in the form of a future DLC. That said the content is done really well and if you’re looking for a journey that takes you away from all of the action games on the market today, then I’m sure you’ll really enjoy what FAR: Lone Sails offers. The game most definitely gets a thumbs up as it feels great in my wheelhouse of gaming styles."

Action Adventure|General|,"Aug 18, 2020",E,William Chyr Studio LLC,88,William Chyr Studio LLC,Manifold Garden,6.0,"Mantifold Garden after 7 years of creation there’s an uneasiness in Manifold Garden, developer William Chyr’s architectural oasis that shifts and repeats itself into seemingly infinity. It’s a game I’m drawn to and terrified by, an unsettling yet stunning experience set in an MCE inspired world, where each structure is a puzzle and brings with it a sense of “impossibility” shapes that shouldn’t work, but do. Somehow. There is no one guiding me through the garden; instruction is built into its design. The first puzzle is a lesson in gravity. A button is dangling from the ceiling, and I have to walk on walls to reach it. To get there, I essentially switch into different dimensional planes, each of which is associated with color. It will make more sense as you play hands on, but trying to explain what’s going on verbally, or even written out, is a significant challenge. My assumption of how things are supposed to work are broken down by the game’s mechanics. I have to shift perspective by activating a different plane, which changes my view. I mean this in a literal sense: With a click, the wall becomes the floor and a new world opens up to explore. From there, I continue to play with gravity to solve the game’s puzzles. Doing so rids the world of an implied corruption that’s taking over, represented by dark clouds that obscure parts of Manifold Garden’s geometry. I learn more about the world and its story with each new garden I reach, although the specifics are often more implied than explained. The game can be finished in up to six hours, although time starts to have less meaning the more you dig in. Manifold Garden isn’t a garden in the traditional sense. Blocks grow like apples from geometric trees dotted across the world, and it’s these blocks that are the keys to the world. The blocks are each associated with a color, depending on what tree they’re pulled from. The objective is often immediately clear when entering an area: I see the trees, growing their blocks. Elsewhere, there’s a door to unlock, powered by a receptacle where I’m to plug in the correctly colored block. But it’s not as simple as picking up the block and moving it to its gate; blocks are locked to their respective color planes, and I must manipulate gravity to get it where it needs to go. Anyone who enjoyed Portal or Portal 2 may have some understanding of the sort of thinking required to solve Manifold Garden’s puzzles easier. Early puzzles are meant to teach me the way the garden works more than challenge me, but puzzles become more complex as Manifold Garden opens up. Just when I think I’ve grasped the logic of the world, something changes, my perspective shifts, and the uneasiness of infinity settles in again. Manifold Garden invokes a sense of anxiety, like a dream I’ve always had and never understood. I’m chasing something through a looping forest, but whatever I’m following; I never know what it is; remains just out of reach. The truth of that these environments don’t go on forever. The loops, like the blocks, are tools to help me escape, to interact with the environment and solve puzzles. And the place where my anxiety and the game’s design collide the hardest takes place on the edge of a platform, over which I must throw myself. I encountered this lesson early on in an area with Manifold Garden’s never-ending stairs. The stairs loop around a vertical structure that extends forever in both directions; I move up and down the structure in both directions, but I always return to where I started. Then I realize I need to go across the short gap. And I must fall into the void to do so, I jump, or, rather, fall. There is no jump, I can only walk until there is no longer floor. So I fall. I fall past the stairs. I fall, and fall, and fall, until I land right back on the very same platform. Except I’ve shifted to another plane on that structure, which means the stairs are now horizontal, not vertical. I can finally reach a different area, falling past different variations of the world, controlled by which plane I was on when I pitched myself into nothingness. This isn’t infinity, it’s a tool. When I look into the void, the void doesn’t look back. In this world, the void offers solutions. The blocks I found and their uses change as I enter more complex areas, and later I stumble upon waterfalls, another Escher reference. Manifold Garden is not frustrating or confusing, even if my explanations of what I do in it may be. Chyr has been working on the game for seven years, and he’s used that time to design a world that challenges its inhabitants without being cruel. I often feel like I have no idea what I’m doing, but I never feel despondent or troubled by that confusion. A breakthrough will come, and the game’s environment itself feels like it wants to be played with and experimented upon. I’ve just must be willing to submit myself to Manifold Garden's experience."
