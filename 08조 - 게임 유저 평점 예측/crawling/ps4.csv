The time element is very cool as its based on your movement or lack of movement as to whether time is moving.  My one complaint would be that the environments can begin to blend together and look very similar and things can feel somewhat repetitive.  At this price point though these are easy concessions to accept and feel hardly worth mentioning.  If you are a gamer on a budget or just craving a game of stealth, then Shadwen is for you!","May 17, 2016"
Simulation|Space|Combat|,51,34BigThings,tbd,E10+,34BigThings,Redout: Space Assault,"Welp, if you're a huge Starfox 64 fan you could spend $10 and an afternoon in worse ways.  But even as a budget title, this game will have most scratching their heads with some perplexingly bad elements and more than one crises of identity.  The game can't decide if it wants to be on-rails or free-flying.  The game can't decide if it had tight, satisfying controls or loose, unresponsive ones.  The game can't decide if it has several repetitive missions or complex missions.  Problems like this hold the game back throughout, so that soon after the initial promise wears off it becomes a bit of a slog to complete.  Probably still worth the time and money if you're forgiving.","Jan 22, 2021"

All the features, upgrades and settings you could need plus it has split screen multi player that's always a good thing to see these days. Plus the handling especially on controller is sublime, It feels just right, I also like the camera if you notice will slightly draws in, and away from the car on acceleration, which gives the sense of acceleration, nice touch and the sense of speed is good here to. Many of these reviews clearly didn't give this game a chance and went into it like i did thinking it was just a Dirt Rip off, not at all Codemasters and the like should be a bit worried if this is V-Rally first attempt in this generation of gaming.

Finish line did a great job recreating it. There were changes I noticed that at first I though were done by Finish line but they said later it they were from the Overdrive edition no one heard of. I saw they tweaked a few things like the hazards and weapons to eliminate some frustrating parts. Of course I still question it was a good idea to add the health bar. I mean it's good not to be instakilled so quickly but I you have too much health that it takes too long to kill someone. Anyway the other issue that was obvious was there way no online multiplayer which this game really could use. They said it was cause the game did not originally have that and adding it would be to expensive at this point. Of course that didn't mean they didn't want to. They hope the game gets big enough that they soon could add it in the future. Overall it's great to have this game again and hope they do eventually add online play.,"Apr 22, 2014"

Things that hurt the game are lack of save/continue, worthless abilities (the dash will actually get you killed most times) and brain dead crew members.  The character selection is nothing more than cosmetic.  Having the characters with different stats or abilities would have added replay value.  This would solve the other issue, in that your main character is very weak, gaining damage bonus only with ally crew members.  Having the choice of a stronger character or faster character may have alleviated the frustration.  Slow xp progression means a marathon play of the game to unlock most abilities.  A story mode with xp progression and save/load feature would have been ideal, and perhaps a marathon mode that starts the player with a limited loadout (or even a choice of a few specific abilities) would better suited to appease both types of players, the 20 minute session or the 2-3 hour play through.

In addition to the arcade controls, the return of 3-Click swings appeals to nostalgic gamers who prefer to set power and accuracy by tapping a button rather than moving a thumbstick. Those looking for an extra challenge can turn on Tour settings. When playing with Tour controls, the length of your backswing and speed of your follow through determine power, while the club path through the ball will be the most important factor in accounting for accuracy. Fans can also mix and match all three settings to create their own custom gameplay style. Courses themselves also affect how your shots are played, as firmer, links-style courses like St. Andrews provides more bounce and roll, while softer courses such as TPC Sawgrass have less bounce and be more receptive to spin.

For about 2 years I have been waiting for the perfect console mmorpg and finally was pulled in by black desert. Its hack and slash fighting makes it easy to level up. Although the controls are a bit tough to get used to because it's not like a traditional mmo it really sucks you in once you get the hang of it. You can do a lot more than what I've seen in other games as far as farming and objectives you can set your self instead of just grinding quests. Farming supplies and being a ""merchant"" with a cart is actually something which makes the game more immersive. It's not necessarily ""pay to win"" as most of the micro transactions just make it more convenient to progress a little faster and most the stuff you have to pay for is really just cosmetic. I used to play WoW for about 10 years but as I have gotten older my body couldnt take long gaming sessions sitting at a desk playing in 1 position for much longer. Then came along Elder Scrolls Online for console and I was immersed in that from the time it came out to about a year ago so roughly about 3 years of heavy daily playing. As with any mmo the ""grind"" felt more more like an obligation because I repaying a monthly subscription and finding good gear became really boring after you could easily customize any gear you had to look a certain way.","Aug 22, 2019"

However, Milestone has made strides in the handling department as the bikes in this game feel much, much better than the past few installments. The game looks good, although it largely looks the same as the past few releases. The difficulty is fantastic. If you want to be challenged, there's a level of difficulty for that. The main draw back is the lack of depth that the career mode still has. If there is one thing that I'd like to see them make a push to improve by a decent bit by MotoGP 19, it's the career mode.

The music was excellent and gave me a relaxing vibe that complemented the puzzles so well.  I liked that they tried to add a narrative and also break up the monotony of doing puzzles by adding the hotel aspect and some mystery, but it felt lacking.

What’s different this time around when you play Mafia III? We’re getting straight to the action as we tell Lincoln’s tale. Faster, Baby! takes place alongside events in the game… but in an entirely new town and with new gameplay experiences. A civil rights leader is murdered while investigating local sheriff, Walter “Slim” Beaumont. Other activists are next on the list – and it’s up to Lincoln and Roxy Laveau (daughter of Charles “The Voice” Laveau) to get to the bottom of what’s happening. As for Sinclair Parish – it may be fictional, but it’s based upon how a few towns used to be, says Hangar 13’s Narrative Director, Bill Harms.  It’s a place where some folks tried to preserve a narrow-minded way of life.  Minorities weren’t welcome, especially after dark. “Just like the main game, we wanted to capture a snapshot of a specific time and place in American history, and let the player experience it.” Since Sinclair Parish is a small rural township in the countryside near the Bayou, expect lots of opportunities to tear through turns, jump gaps and run from the law.

The art, music and voices are 100% authentic. My son is a huge fan of the show, so he got a lot of excitement out of this game. It also took a bit of time to get the final trophy which asks you to beat the final boss without taking a hit. Only 0.5% of people unlocked that trophy, so it's ironic that the #1 complaint is length yet people weren't willing to spend any additional time to complete the one challenge that the game gives you to do.

There are 29 levels to this game, eventually the game gets tough, Dark Souls tough, all types of obstacles will be thrown your way, most will be scared off, the controls are funky (in a good way, it just takes a bit of time) it wasn't till I passed 10 levels or so that I felt comfortable with the controls, but even then they are always throwing new stuff at you, at some points it feels like your traversing a 3d ikaruga...

For example, the whole season I blocked EVERY advance of Kate, in the end the game told me that ""I denied having a relationship"" and David kicked my ass. WHAT F***** RELATIONSHIP? That's just one example of so many scenes that felt forced. Really kind of disappointed as this led me to distance myself from the characters and story as in ""well I cannot Change it anyway so why get invested and try"" but extra points for Jesus and his disciples riding in as cavallry to save the day (I kid you not).

Adventure|3D|First-Person|,71,Mighty Polygon,6.0,None,Ravenscourt,Relicta,"Relicta is a first-person puzzle game whose main mechanics combine magnetism and gravity. The player is equipped with a pair of special gloves that allow them to change the magnetic and gravitational properties of experimental cubes scattered around each level. These cubes can be moved by the player, either carrying them bodily or using magnetism or gravity. They can also be placed on teleporting machines to warp them to another teleporter and help solve puzzles. Mechanics really come alive when combined in ingenious ways. For instance, magnetism can be used to repel or attract cubes, but repelling a cube that has previously “anti-gravitated” gives you a frictionless device that will retain inertia until it collides against something solid, like a wall (or your skull). It can even be used as a means of transport for the player to reach new places. Cubes can also be used to power up some devices, in order to operate doors and force fields. As the player progresses towards more complex puzzles, they will encounter other devices - magnetic plates, elevators, buttons or even drones capable of nullifying magnetic and gravitational fields as well as stealing cubes.","Aug  3, 2020"

I purchased the game as part of an upper body and cardio regimen, and not only is it tons of fun, but I huff, puff, and sweat like the big bad wolf having a stroke. While it's true that the story line in campaign mode is not exactly robust, what it does have is great, and the feel of looking around a fight club or boxing ring, or having Rocky train you in the gym in is just plain fantastic. If I had one complaint it would be that the PSVR doesn't track well if you are facing away from the camera, but that's more a system limitation than an issue with the game itself. I know whenever i play I burn a ton of calories and have a ton of fun, so as long as you aren't looking for more than that I can absolutely recommend this game wholeheartedly. The opponents get better as your stamina improves, and the online play    is great when the internet bandwidth allows it to be.

Action|Platformer|2D|,76,GameDesignDan,5.5,T,Curve Digital,10 Second Ninja X,"If you want a cheesy story to go along with a hard platformer, this is for you! The game takes inspiration from Super Meat Boy, but faster paced. As the name implies, you have 10 seconds to finish the level. This is done by destroying every single robot (which there are a variety of), and not being electrocuted (which can also happen many ways). There are multiple ""stages"" that have multiple levels. These levels get progressively more difficult the more you complete, and each stage has it's own twist that changes how you play the game. Each stage also has different tilesets and music. In my opinion, the default control map is good, but be aware there is no control mapping. My only complaint is the learning curve. The levels, as I said, do get harder, but each time you enter a new stage, it becomes significantly more difficult, although I think that's the point. If you've never played a game like Super Meat Boy or 10 Second Ninja, you should definitely try this game.","Jul 19, 2016"

Personally I like the characters and the gothic environment including the somber, mellow musical score.

Role-Playing|General|Strategy|Turn-Based|Tactics|,78,Stoic,7.6,T,Versus Evil,The Banner Saga 2,"Like every good sequel it does what the prequel did and improved it. You get the strengths of the first game and some good additions I will describe below. It is a mixture of a strategic RPG and survival management. The mixture of this made a challenging gameplay with lot of hard decision. Also the art style, soundtrack and graphics are unique and enhance the immersion. The world is inspired by Nordic aka Viking culture and mythology. Story: The northern lands of Varl (Giants) and Humans have been overrun by the Dredge (Humans made of stone). You have lead your Clan of survivors through a lot of struggles of the prequel and have defeated Bellower but with a harsh price. The city of Boersgard is save for a while but cant be defended against the sheer numbers of Dredge. The Dredge will continue to overrun the continent and you have to continue your journey with the survivors to a safe place. There is even a darker possibility on the horizon that the Dredge are also on the run from something worse but nothing is sure. Maybe the capital of Aberrang where the human king resides is safe enough. Like the prequel it will be a struggle to survive. Especially if you try to safe as many people as possible and also keep them fed and in high morals. I enjoyed the stories and the characters have grown on me as I lead and protected them. You have the option to import your save from the first game and take all decisions, characters, items and resources with you. Game play: Firstly the strategic RPG parts. It is turn based but not with a speed attribute. You are in control of up to 6 characters per battle. Each side has alternating turns no mater the numbers except one is down to the last man standing. Example you have 6 characters so after 12 turns it is your same characters turn again. When the enemy has 8 it will be 16 before the same characters turn. Be careful! This is dangerous when you have spared the most powerful enemies until the end. You have an armor and health rating. Health is also attack power and this is an interesting concept. Lets say attack power 9 against armor 7 with 10 health. This is 9-7 = 2 damage and with this health is 10-2= 8. The possible damage output is lowered from 10 to 8 for the damaged character. It gives depth and some tactical options. Each character can level up, learn abilities and improve the stats a bit. Then there is the survival part. Some say it is similar to the classic “The Oregon Trail” but I think this is not familiar anymore. You are the leader of a clan / caravan and must protect its people. You travel through the lands with them and must get food and this is also bought with renown points. You get those for defeating enemies and some events. It is harsh decision making between level up and buying more food. Starvation is a thing and more people need more food. There is a moral rating system and this will be also with benefits and penalties. There are random and scripted events where you have to made decisions. Your decisions mostly have consequences and you can gain or lose heroes, food, moral and people too. It is a cruel situation and as leader you have to make harsh decisions or let others pay the price. I forgot that in battle defeated heroes need recovery time except on easy difficulty (And more on hard). You can still use them but they are really weakened. Resting improves moral, heals wounded heroes but it takes time and consumes food. I think this is a good set up and the rest is easy to learn. These parts together made an excellent experience. The sequel made a lot of improvements. Now you can train clansman to become warriors for the price of some resources but beware clansman will collect resources too from time to time (Less resources for less clansman). Training has now has a purpose. A trainer sets up special training battles for your characters. If you win by fulfilling the conditions you get a lot of renown. Also some good combo ideas and shown how to use characters efficiently. Of cause there are new characters, items, abilities, enemies and classes. There are a few additions in gameplay like barricades and obstacles on the battlefield. All this makes the gameplay better. The game worked really well with its story, characters and challenges. Even normal difficulty gets really hard later on when you want to be noble leader and safe as many lives as possible. The graphics look even better than before. It looks hand drawn and the world is beautiful. I truly like the art work for the characters, cities and items.  The soundtrack is truly good and also a bit better than the prequel. I was amazed that they used artist I already cherish like Malukah, Peter Hollens and Taylor Davis. They have good YouTube channels by the way. Overall this surpass the prequel and is easily worth a 10/10 for me. The gameplay is superb in this combination and with the story and characters it is a masterpieces.","Jul  5, 2016"

In Unravel 2 we play together, sometimes we race each other, but all of the time we figure the puzzles out together, deciding what role each of us will play in solving the puzzle - and we laugh at the situations we get ourselves into.  And we help each other, I am not as good as her at the side to side jumping  - so often she grabs me on my back.  It's super fun.

Role-Playing|General|Strategy|Turn-Based|Tactics|,79,Stoic,7.7,T,Versus Evil,The Banner Saga,"A remarkable game. It is a mixture of a strategic RPG and survival management. The mixture of this made a challenging gameplay with lot of hard decision. Also the art style, soundtrack and graphics are unique and enhance the immersion. The world is inspired by Nordic aka Viking culture and mythology. Story: The goddess Loom Mother created the humans by learning to weave life into the world. The other gods wanted to do this too but had often not the skills or patience. Some imitated this by creating other races like the Varl (Giants) or Horseborn (Centaurs). One angry god however created the Dredge who are living humanoids out of stone to destroy the other races. He was punished by the Loom Mother but this ended accidentally with his dead to every gods shock as they thought themselves to be immortal. The gods then fought and killed themselves or are in hiding but there is no evidence for the last. Meanwhile the before fighting Varl and Humans made peace to repel the Dredge. They won and the Dredge seem to be gone. However many years later the sun stopped at the sky and the Dredge seem to return in numbers unlike before. This will be a struggle for survival. I like the story and the dread. You feel the menace and the harsh battle for survival. Together with the well done characters it is an immersive and enjoyable adventure. Game play: Firstly the strategic RPG parts. It is turn based but not with a speed attribute. You are in control of up to 6 characters per battle. Each side has alternating turns no mater the numbers except one is down to the last man standing. Example you have 6 characters so after 12 turns it is your same characters turn again. When the enemy has 8 it will be 16 before the same characters turn. Be careful! This is dangerous when you have spared the most powerful enemies until the end. You have an armor and health rating. Health is also attack power and this is an interesting concept. Lets say attack power 9 against armor 7  with 10 health. This is 9-7 = 2 damage and with this health is 10-2= 8. The possible damage output is lowered from also 10 to 8 for the damaged character. You can attack the armor instead but this is a separated lower value. You do at least 1 damage no mater the armor but with high differences the hit percentage is lower and lower. You have also willpower that can be added. You have a stock and a value for max adding. The value will be added to the result. Lets take the above example and use 2 willpower. Damage 9-7=2+2=4. Useful in many situation as it can also be used to increase moving range. The character level up with enough kills but you must pay the level up with more and more renown (See below) for this and it is not much status increase per level. Also you can equip better artifacts (only 1 per character) and each 2 levels your willpower based special skills get better but also more expensive. A simpler but really enjoyable system with some depth. Then there is the survival part. Some say it is similar to the classic “The Oregon Trail” but I think this is not familiar anymore. You are the leader of a caravan and must protect its people. You travel through the lands with them and must get food and this is also bought with renown points. You get those for defeating enemies and some events. It is harsh decision making between level up and buying more food. Starvation is a thing and more people need more food. There is a moral rating system and this will be also with benefits and penalties. There are random and scripted events where you have to made decisions. Your decisions mostly have consequences and you can gain or lose heroes, food, moral and people too. It is a cruel situation and as leader you have to make harsh decisions or let others pay the price. I forgot that defeated heroes need recovery time except on easy difficulty (And more on hard). You can still use them but they are really weakened. Resting improves moral, heals wounded heroes but it takes time and consumes food. I think this is a good set up and the rest is easy to learn. The game worked really well with its story, characters and challenges. Even normal gets really hard later on when you want to be noble leader and safe as many lives as possible. Then there is the graphics. It looks hand-drawn and the world and characters look amazing. Another game where I would buy an artbook. The soundtrack is truly good and I was amazed that they used artist I already cherish like Malukah, Peter Hollens and Taylor Davis. They have good YouTube channels by the way. With this the game is a masterpiece for me. Overall a good game creates emotion and has an addicting gameplay. This is true for the Banner saga and the mixture is worth 10/10 for me.","Jan 12, 2016"

Despite being produced by a medium sized video-game company called Tequila Works, The Invisible Hours is a fully realized experience that excels in every design category.  The plot is expertly woven with well fleshed out characters and dialogue.  Meanwhile, the acting/voice work are top notch and some of the best performances I've seen in the video game industry.  The way everything all fits together in the game design is seriously wondrous to behold.  In addition, the game structure expertly shows off VR's unique entertainment strengths.  The sense of presence in the game is very engrossing and one of the coolest experiences I've had in PS VR so far.  The world in this game is so immersive that it really feels like its happening in real time.  The atmosphere is stunning and the attention to detail is impeccable.  The controls are very simple, intuitive, and functional.  And best of all, I experienced no motion sickness the entire game.  There is no traditional gameplay per-se but it works very well here and I feel if there was, it would only get in the way of the experience. The only minor detraction I can find with the game is that sometimes it can become tiring to follow everything that happens if your mind starts to wander, but you can take a break whenever, so its not that big of a deal.  The Invisible Hours is also split up into chapters and they aren't too long so the pacing is well done and helps with breaks.  Despite the short chapters, the game has a lot of replay as there is a bunch of content to observe and it becomes more enriching with every subsequent play-through of the events.  In conclusion, The Invisible Hours is one of the best VR experiences the medium has to offer right now and ranks up with the best video games of all time and I'm sure it will become a classic in the future!

I got the same emotional rollercoaster which I loved in the first. I just missed Max from the other game. You get emotionally attached to all the characters. Max was just so relatable to myself so she was my favorite. You will relate to one character at least because their attitudes are very realistic. This series is a beautiful experience. Every gamer should atleast try both but this game definitely gets a bit lifted up if you play the previous original first. Still great tho. And if you get the deluxe you will get an episode with Max!

Miscellaneous|Compilation|,80,Capcom,7.9,T,Capcom,Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy,"The fact that the game was a visual novel,and never had played one before, made me think that it wouldn't be that enjoyable. But I was just plain wrong (not only for this game but for the genre in general) and all I had to do to learn that this game is a masterpiece was to just play the first 30 minutes. This is all it takes to realize that this game isn't going to make you let it off. In fact, you are going to have an unforgettable time. The cases are brilliant and amazing with tons of humor, thrill and overwhelming twists that will blow your mind. There are two main parts of the game. The invastigations and the trials. The invastigations weren't my favorite parts most of the times but the trials are phenomenal. About the humor trait of this game, there wasn't a time that 5 minutes passed without laughing. It's original, amazing and of the most important traits of this game. There were 3 cases specifically that will always be in my mind since they touch perfection. I was so overwhelmed and mind blows playing these. Not that the others aren't amazing of course,but those 3 are making you empathize and appreciate the characters way more. However, subjectivity is a huge factor in the matter, but trust me, not those 3.There is also another one who made me change opinion about another character completely, and now he one of my favorites.As for the rest  characters in general, they are all unique. Some good, some great, some unforgettable, some average, some bad. All personalities are there. I rarely emphasize with characters in games and this one is one of those that made me do just that. The dialogues are incredibly good written and the voice lines used in court are iconic. Also, the soundtrack is just amazing, as well as the incredible sprites and their animations. In conclusion, this game is almost perfect and you definitely should give it a try,even if you don't feel like being into this genre.","Apr  9, 2019"

Strategy|Turn-Based|Tactics|,83,Nippon Ichi Software,5.9,T,NIS America,Disgaea 4 Complete+,"The ultimate version of Disgaea 4. It has of cause the main game and all content from “Disgaea 4 A promise revisited” including all additional characters, scenarios, gameplay improvements with some from other Disgaea games and some tweaks to the game.  For this game they add a few things that you might miss but are nice to have like for example skill speed ups or an auto save after battles. For me this is the complete or ultimate version of my favorite Disgaea game. The enjoyable crazy story, dark humor, quirky characters and excellent gameplay won me over. To give you an overview over the Disgaea franchise: The Disgaea series are strategy RPGs with unique characters, dark humor and endless possibilities to improve your characters. While other RPGs cap at level 99 here you can reach level 9999 (no typo) and even reincarnate to increase you stats further. You can improve your skills and items also. There is an item world where you can improve all items to ridiculous levels. You can also throw teammates (do this carefully with Prinnies) and later games use fusions and other interesting mechanics. Then there is the humor and characters. It is well interwoven and there are so much good jokes, side-blows and sarcasm. The story is always a good mixture of awesomeness, seriousness, humor and enjoyable character quirks. All games shine in this regard and so far there is no weak entry. The story evolves around a new cast of characters. The main character Valvatorez is a vampire who has not drunk blood in ages because of a promise which weakened him (He was ultimate secret boss level strong back then and a legend). He is a man of his word, non-corruptible and knows well about Sardines. The werewolf Fenrich has chosen him as his master and is his right hand man, absolute loyal but with own ideas. For the rest I avoid spoilers a bit. There is a girl who thinks everything is a dream, a final boss in training, a grim-reaper and a greedy person. Those have great chemistry and work well. Each game has a fantastic cast but those won me over the most. The story starts simple but escalates into a wild and enjoyable ride. So much dark humor, crazy ideas and twist. I fully admit you must like this kind of craziness but if you do not why even play a Disgaea game? In the story and character regard this game fully delivers. The gameplay is great too. It is a turn based strategy RPG. You know the drill here. Move your characters on the map. Attack use your abilities and defeat your enemies. However the Disgaea games have more than most other games. You have colored Geo panels with pyramids given effects. Destroying them can cause chain reactions that damage all characters on them. You can throw characters, build towers with characters, fuse monsters or equip monster characters as weapons, improve items in the item world or characters, gain items with a bonus gouge and much more. The game has a lot of depth and you can easily get 100 hours of playtime out of it in a single playthrough. If you play all content and want to see all I can easily see this past 300 hours. Here a bit of advice: For power leveling: Level 99 enemies give far more experience then they should by comparison. If you get skills that can vanquish a group of those you are fast in the several hundred levels. Stage 5.2 with increased difficulty to 8 is the best level up area for a while. You can link characters together in a way that 10% experience are gained which power level weaker characters in a few minutes. Evilities and skills are very useful and you should look out for them. Fused and monster character weapons are powerful if chosen correctly. Finally there are a lot of useful tricks to find and explore. Presentation wise the game looks and sound amazing. No misstep here and I am a huge fan of the style of the franchise. Overall this is my favorite version of my favorite game. A must play for Disgaea and RPG fans if you can endure the enjoyable craziness.","Oct 29, 2019"

This, for Me, makes this My ATF (All-Time Fav) hoops game, & on the PS4 it's just absolutely gorgeous. The only gripe for true purists will be the over-the-top WWEish MyCareer mode which includes cheesy cut-scenes & the innately annoying knack for your counterpart to always be catching fire & carrying his team to an unrealistic degree. Having said that, when you're dropping 20 & 10 in your rookie showcase game you can understand the developers pushing your competition. For those who enjoyed catching fire in the heyday of NBA Jam you'll LOVE 2k14's varying levels of getting ""ON FIRE!!"", including defensively if you make a few good plays on D (steals, blocks, etc). The visuals are stunning, presentation is as realistic as I've ever seen & they even use the Real Voice feature to have real coaches & players during interviews. The online is a different twist on park hoops which allows you to watch & join games going on live by calling ""next"".

However it's the VR implementation that really shines for me - never before have I felt so in-touch with a VR world - subtle use of the controller vibration and some clever tricks really gave objects in the world a tactile sensation. I spent about 5 minutes just lifting up a dumbbell and a pot-plant trying to work out what the game was doing that made one of them ""feel"" heavier than the other. Outstanding.

Platformer|2D|Action|Platformer|2D|,90,Ubisoft Montpellier,8.4,E10+,Ubisoft,Rayman Legends,"There are several differences and new features in this PS4 version. In this version the textures of the game are more compressed, so you can see that the game’s graphics are clearer and more detailed than before. You will also see that there is no loading time when you enter or exit a level, which makes the navigation even faster and more enjoyable. Ubisoft has also integrated a new Camera Mode on PS4. By pressing the touchpad of the PS4 joystick, you pause the game and enter this mode, and by moving your fingers on the touchpad, you zoom in and out on the image and drag the image frame; and finally, by pressing the Share button, you can take a photo and share it with everyone. This Camera Mode is a great way to observe in detail all the characters and settings of the game, and a great way of expression to create wacky images with the elements found in the game. On PS4, you can also use the touchpad to scrape the famous Lucky Tickets, then you will really feel like you’re scraping lottery tickets (with the sound of scraping straight from the PS4 joystick). Finally, in this PS4 version, you’ll also find new playable heroes: Assassin Ray (a character inspired by Edward Kenway, the hero of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag), Funky Ray (a delusional character that you can unlock by using Uplay points), and Champion Ray (a character who will be offered to the best players of the community and those who live in this community; this character correspond to the new VIP status, visible in the rankings of online challenges).

Fantastically clever boss battles and dungeons push you to learn new skills with your companions while not being overly punishing. My only slight critique would be the lack of times juggling party members was necessary. The few times this did occur it was a delight to master how a particular problem would be best addressed by switching between characters on the fly (no pun intended). Old mechanics are rarely reused across dungeons which does rob you of some of those nice moments that come from building upon and mastering skills specific to puzzles and tasks you have previously completed throughout the game.
